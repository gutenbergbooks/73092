<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In presenting this volume to the public the author does not claim much originality.
He merely desires to reproduce the religious principles which were sown into his heart
by his parents, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ז״ל‎</span>, and cultivated by the great teachers of Israel—the Prophets, the Soferim, and their
successors—in order that the blessing which he himself has always derived from these
principles may also be enjoyed by his brethren. The original sources of religious
knowledge, viz., the Scriptures and Post-Biblical Jewish Literature, are of course
accessible to all, and every one may sit at the feet of our great teachers and listen
to their instruction. But there are many who are in need of assistance, who require
the aid of an interpreter. The present volume is intended to render that assistance
and to serve as such interpreter. The author therefore addresses himself to his brethren,
especially to his disciples, in the words of an ancient teacher of the Mishnah (Aboth
v. 25), “Turn it, and turn it over again;” and if he cannot add also “for everything
is in it,” he hopes <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>that that which is in it will be found useful to those who seek religious knowledge,
and that it will prove an incentive to many “to learn and teach, to heed and do, and
to fulfil in love all the words of instruction in the Divine Law.”
</p>
<p>To a great extent this work owes its origin to the warm interest which the late Mr.
Jacob A. Franklin, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ע״ה‎</span>, took in all matters connected with Judaism. He repeatedly urged upon the author
the necessity of publishing a book on the Jewish Religion. A plan was suggested, discussed,
and finally adopted; but the progress of the work was slow on account of other literary
engagements of the author. Although Mr. Franklin departed from our midst long before
it was completed, his philanthropy, which survived him, has a share in its completion,
the book being printed at the expense of the Jacob A. Franklin Trust Fund for the
advancement of Judaism. In recognition of these facts the author dedicates this work—

<h2 class="main">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first edition being exhausted a second edition has been prepared. There is no
cause for any change in the body of the book. Religion, both “<span lang="de">Glaubenslehre</span>” and “<span lang="de">Pflichtenlehre</span>,” are given as objectively as possible, and the most rigid examination of all that
is taught in “The Jewish Religion,” discovered no misstatement. A few unimportant
errors, which according to the Psalmist (Ps. xix) are excusable, are rectified in
the list of Errata. Questions concerning religious principles which have arisen in
the Community since the publication have been foreseen and dealt with according to
Law and Tradition. A few notes are added in the second edition, where further <span class="corr" id="xd32e237" title="Source: elucidatians">elucidations</span> seemed necessary. There is also appended the bibliography of text-books of Jewish
Religion, an abstract of a paper on Religious Education, read before the Jews’ College
Literary Society, and the prayer which in the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogues is
offered up by the Barmitzvah when called to the Law. The latter practice is worthy
of imitation.

<h2 class="super">THE JEWISH RELIGION.</h2>
<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Man is the most privileged of creatures; he has been made in the image of God. His
privilege is still further enhanced by the fact that he has been made aware of his
distinction” (Aboth iii. 14). There is in man a consciousness or feeling of a certain
relation between him and a superior Being, on whose Will his own existence depends.
This consciousness is the basis of religion, but is not religion itself. It is the
influence which this feeling exercises over man’s actions and conduct in life that
forms the essence of religion. When man begins to feel that he is responsible for
his actions to a higher Being, and forms his actions in harmony with this feeling,
he may be called religious. Two elements must therefore be distinguished in religion:
the notion of man’s dependence on and responsibility to a superior Being, and the
influence of this notion on his actions: religious belief and religious practice,
or faith and duty. Religious belief or faith, in its most simple and most general
form, may be said to be common almost to all mankind; and in the great variety of
faiths, produced by <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>various circumstances and experiences, this simple idea may easily be detected as
the fundamental principle of all of them. The same can be said with regard to religious
practice. There are certain fundamental principles of duty which are recognised and
adopted by the most diverse religious sects; they form, as it were, the common stem
from which a large number of branches spring forth in all directions. These branches
diverge more and more the larger they grow and the more numerous they become.
</p>
<p><i>Judaism</i> is one of these various religions. It has been the source of most of the religions
of the civilised world, and is destined to become, in its simplest principles, the
universal religion.
</p>
<p id="wij">What is Judaism? or what does Judaism teach its adherents to believe, and what does
it teach them to do? The answers to these two questions form the main subject of every
book on our holy religion. The answer to the first question must include our doctrine
about God, His attributes, His relation to the material world, and especially to man;
the mission of man, his hopes and fears. The answer to the second question must include
our duties toward God, toward our fellow-men, and toward ourselves. Both answers must
be based on that which we are taught in the Holy Writings, and especially in the Torah.
Recourse may be had to philosophic speculation, to which, indeed, the first question
peculiarly invites, but the result must be rectified by the teaching of the Torah.
</p>
<p>In accordance with the maxim, “The secret things belong to the Lord our God; but those
things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>ever: <i>that we may do all the words of this Law</i>,” abstruse metaphysical disquisitions about the essence and the attributes of the
Divine Being will be avoided in the present work, as also every attempt at proving,
philosophically or mathematically, truths which have been revealed unto us in a supernatural
way.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2574src" href="#xd32e2574">1</a> But the simple truths taught in the Holy Writings and explained by our sages will
be expounded, the different opinions about them will be examined, and it will be shown
that these truths are not contradicted by common sense or by the results of scientific
research.
</p>
<p>The second question, however, What does Judaism teach us to do? refers to “the things
which are revealed,” and must be treated more fully. Care will be taken, as far as
possible, that nothing be omitted that is required for the right understanding and
the correct estimate of our religious duties.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>Religion therefore includes two elements: faith and practice. In religious life, as
well as in the teaching of religion, both elements are equally essential; faith without
religious practice does not suffice, nor the latter without faith. We are accustomed
to look upon certain dogmas as fundamental, and certain practices as essential, and
are therefore prone to renounce beliefs which are not fundamental in our eyes, and
to abandon such religious practice as seems to us less essential. Hence the frequent
inquiry as to what is the minimum of belief, and what the minimum degree of conformity
to the Law, that Judaism demands. But in reality there can be no compromise in religion,
whether in matters of faith or of practice. Convinced of a certain number of truths,
it is impossible for us to abandon any of them without being false to ourselves; being
convinced of the binding character of certain religious commands and prohibitions,
it would be perverse to pronounce at the same time part of them as superfluous. <i>Judaism is the adherence to the truths taught in the Holy Law, and the faithful obedience
to its precepts.</i>
</p>
<p>The principal Hebrew equivalents for the modern term “Religion,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span>, confirm this view. In the Bible <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה‎</span> signifies “instruction,” and is applied to the teaching of religions truth, as well
as to that of religious precepts. The same is the case with the second term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span> which signifies “firmness,” “perseverance,” or “permanence,” and is used of “consistency”
in faith as well as of conscientiousness in the practice of the Divine ordinances.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2603src" href="#xd32e2603">2</a>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e2574src">1</a></span> When our great theologians, Saadiah, Bachya, Maimonides, Albo, &amp;c., considered it
necessary to write long and abstruse metaphysical essays in order to firmly establish
certain truths, it was done rather for the purpose of combating the views of opponent
theologians than for the instruction of the multitude, and it may fairly be said that
Maimonides has done far greater service to his brethren by the composition of a systematic
code of laws than by his philosophical “Guide.” The former, the <i>Mishneh-Torah</i>, never fails to enlighten those who seek in it enlightenment with regard to some
religious duty, whilst the “Guide” would scarcely relieve anyone of his perplexities
in matters of religious belief. There is a saying in the Talmud Jerus. (Chagigah,
ch. i.), “Would that they had forgotten me, and kept my commandments!” or, in other
words, “Theologians would do better if they were less eager to investigate into the
essence of God and His attributes, and were more anxious to study and to do God’s
commandments.” Instead of devoting their chief attention to the knowledge and the
practice of the Law, they waste their energy and their time in attempts to solve problems
to which the human mind is unequal (S. Plessner, <span lang="de">Religions-Unterricht</span>, p. xxxviii.).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e2574src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">Faith is the implicit and absolute belief in the truth of the communication made to
us and in the trustworthiness of him who makes it to us. The child has faith in its
parents that their wishes or commands are for its good; the pupil in his teachers
that they impart correct knowledge; we have faith in our friends that they have no
intention to deceive us; in the men of science and learning that the results of their
researches may be accepted as well established. In all these cases the faith is but
imperfect and of a relative and temporary character. Time, investigation, and extended
observation and knowledge may either confirm the contents of our faith or may convince
us that we have been in error. This is not the case with religious faith. It keeps
within the boundaries of its own domain and does not encroach on that of the senses
and of reason. Whatever can be known by means of scientific research and thorough
investigation we need not accept on faith. Religion—I have, of course, our own religion,
the Jewish, in mind—does not only not forbid such examination, but even encourages
it. Thus we read in the Book of Proverbs, “A fool believeth every word, <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>but the prudent man looketh well to his going” (xiv. 15). For this purpose God has
given us intellectual faculties that we should employ them in our search for truth.
At the same time, however, He has set limits to our faculties, and there are things
which are beyond these limits, being <i>nistaroth</i>, “things hidden” from our senses, whose existence has been made known to us through
the grace of God, by such means as His infinite wisdom determined. We search and investigate,
examine and demonstrate, within the sphere of our senses; but all that is beyond their
reach belongs to the <i>nistaroth</i>, the knowledge of which can only be imparted to us directly by the Almighty, or indirectly
by those to whom they have been communicated by Him. Our belief with regard to these
<i>nistaroth</i> may be supported or strengthened by philosophical or dialectical arguments, but can
never be proved by mathematical or logical demonstration.
</p>
<p>The sources from which we derive our knowledge of these <i>nistaroth</i> are <i>Revelation</i> and <i>Tradition</i>. God <i>reveals</i> things otherwise unknown to man to such persons or to such a generation as His wisdom
chooses, and from those thus privileged the knowledge spreads to the rest of mankind
by means of <i>Tradition</i>. In addition to these two sources there is a third one in ourselves: God implanted
in our souls certain ideas common to all of us as essential elements of our inner
life, and these ideas form to some extent the basis of our faith. Such is, <i>e.g.</i>, the idea of an all-powerful Being, God, who is the source and origin of everything
in existence.
</p>
<p>There is no real conflict between faith and reason. It may sometimes seem as if there
were such a conflict, <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>and we then naturally begin to doubt. In such cases the truth of our faith may be
doubted, but the correctness of our reasoning is no less subject to doubt. We may
have erroneously included in our faith beliefs which do not belong to it, and on becoming
aware that they are contrary to reason, we cast them aside without the least injury
to our faith. On the other hand, our reason is not perfect; we frequently discover
mistakes in our arguments and conclusions, and reject opinions which we hitherto have
considered as firmly established.
</p>
<p>Through patient and thorough investigation of our doubts, without over-estimation
of our reasoning faculties, we shall be able to settle the seeming conflict between
reason and faith in a satisfactory manner. The examination of our doubts will prove
that none of the truths which the Almighty revealed to mankind are contrary to reason.
</p>
<p>In this way we are enabled to separate from our faith all elements that in reality
are foreign to it; we shall be able to distinguish between faith and superstition.
The latter consists of erroneous notions and beliefs which can be tested and subjected
to the ordinary means of inquiry. Superstition is not tolerated by true religion;
strict adherence to the teachings of our holy religion is the best check to superstitious
beliefs.
</p>
<p id="faith.bible">The importance which the Bible attaches to implicit faith in God and His word may
be gathered from the following passages:—
</p>
<p>“And <i>he</i> (Abraham) <i>believed in the Lord</i>, and He reckoned it to him as righteousness” (Gen. xv. 6). <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>The Hebrew for “righteousness” is in the original <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדקה‎</span> which is used in the Bible as the sum-total of everything good and noble in man’s
life.
</p>
<p>When the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea, it is said of them: “And Israel saw the
great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord:
and <i>they believed in the Lord</i>, and in Moses His servant” (Exod. xiv. 31).
</p>
<p>Again, when Moses and Aaron had sinned at the waters of Meribah by striking the rock
instead of speaking to it, they were rebuked for want of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span> “faith,” in the following words: “Because <i>ye believed not in me</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא האמנתם בי‎</span>) to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring
this assembly into the land which I have given them” (Numb. xx. 12).
</p>
<p>When Moses in his song <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האזינו‎</span> blamed the Israelites for their evil doings, he called them “children in whom there
is no <i>faith</i>” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמון‎</span> (Deut. xxxii. 20).
</p>
<p>King Jehoshaphat, addressing the army before the battle, says: “Have <i>faith</i> in the Lord and you will be safe; have confidence in His prophets and you will succeed”
(2 Chron. xx. 20).
</p>
<p>In the same sense Isaiah says to King Ahaz: “If you have no <i>faith</i>, surely you will not be safe” (Isa. vii. 9).
</p>
<p>Also Jeremiah, speaking of Israel’s disobedience to the word of God, exclaims: “<i>The faith</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האמונה‎</span> <i>is perished</i>, and it is cut off from their mouth” (Jer. vii. 28).
</p>
<p>The prophet Habakkuk, praying to God for an explanation why evil-doers succeed and
prosper, receives <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>the divine answer: “The righteous shall live <i>by his faith</i>” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וצדיק באמונתו יחיה‎</span> (Hab. ii. 4); and when Hosea predicts the future redemption of Israel, he tells them
in the name of God, “And I will betroth thee unto me <i>by faith</i>” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וארשתיך לי באמונה‎</span> (Hos. ii. 22).
</p>
<p>Our teachers, the sages and rabbis, who succeeded the prophets, have been equally
emphatic in commending religious faith. The following are a few of their sayings concerning
faith:—
</p>
<p>“Great is the merit of faith. Through their faith in the Creator of the universe the
Israelites were inspired by the holy spirit, and were enabled to sing praises to the
Lord.” “Faith in the Lord was the source of all the temporal and eternal blessings
which were bestowed upon Abraham; it gave him the enjoyment of this world and the
world to come.” “When the Psalmist says: ‘This gate leads to the Lord; righteous people
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדיקים‎</span>) shall come in through it,’ he denoted by the term ‘righteous’ <i>those who possess faith in God</i>” (Yalkut on Ex. xiv. 31).
</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the Torah and the prophets most emphatically declare <i>faith</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span> to be a very essential element in Judaism, it does not seem to have the same importance
in the writings of Jewish theologians and philosophers, some of whom have endeavoured
to substitute reasoning and logical arguments for simple faith, and to rebuild upon
scientific research the religious edifice erected on the foundation of faith. The
following are the utterances of the principal Jewish theologians since the close of
the Talmud on the relation between faith and reason:—
</p>
<p id="faith.saadiah">The Gaon Saadiah of Fayyum wrote a book <span class="corr" id="xd32e2750" title="Source: On">on</span> <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>creeds and religious beliefs (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמאנאת ואעתקאד־אמונות ודעות‎</span>). In the Introduction to this work the philosopher describes the causes of human
error and doubt, and assumes four classes of believers. There are, first, those who
recognise the truth found by them, cling to it, and are happy in it. There are, secondly,
those who have the true principle before them, but do not recognise it, doubt its
correctness, and abandon it again. The third class includes those who adopt an opinion
without having recognised it as true; they mistake falsehood for truth. The last division
consists of those who form no definite opinion, but remain continually in an unsettled
state of mind. Saadiah is anxious to see at least his co-religionists in the first
class, and his work was intended to help them towards this end.
</p>
<p>According to Saadiah, belief or faith must be an integral part of our soul; the various
truths which form the faith are stored up in the soul as in a repository, completely
ready for use whenever required. It is, however, possible that we store up opinions
as true which are false. Tests must be applied to each opinion in order to ascertain
its right character. Three of the tests are of a general nature, but the fourth has
its force only for us, the believers in the truth of the Holy Writings. The first
three tests will show us whether a certain opinion is confirmed or contradicted by
our senses, by our innate ideas, or by our logical reasoning. In addition to these
we possess a fourth test in the trustworthy communication (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגדה הנאמנת‎</span>), <i>i.e.</i>, the contents of Holy Writ and Tradition. Holy Writ recognises the necessity of the
three general tests, and frequently exhorts us to apply them. On <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>the other hand, Saadiah is convinced that the contents of Holy Writ and Tradition
are never contradicted, but in many cases are confirmed by these tests. Such confirmation
is in reality superfluous; but the human mind feels more at ease when it finds that
the teaching of Holy Writ is supported by other proofs. Besides, attacks on the Bible
come frequently from these tests, and it is therefore useful to learn how to refute
them. According to Saadiah, the truth taught in the Bible can never be contradicted
by the results of scientific or philosophical research.
</p>
<p>Thus to Saadiah philosophy and science are mere luxuries, and cannot be considered
as handmaids to the Torah. They are not studied on account of their intrinsic value
or as helps for the understanding of Holy Writ, but merely for the purpose of procuring
proper weapons for theological warfare, or of superadding the conviction that what
is known to us from the most trustworthy source is confirmed from other less reliable
sources.
</p>
<p id="faith.gabirol">The poet and philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol, who is lost in enthusiasm in contemplating
the powers of the human soul, humbly acknowledges that it was his faith that saved
him from fall and ruin. Referring to man’s faculty of acquiring knowledge, he says
in his “Royal Crown” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר מלכות‎</span>: “Who can comprehend Thy wisdom in giving to the soul the faculty of acquiring knowledge,
on which her existence depends, knowledge being her foundation? She is permanent and
immortal in the same measure as her foundation is well established.” But, reflecting
on human weakness, he expresses his feeling of gratitude to the Creator for His <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>guidance in the following words: “Thou hast done yet more for me. Thou hast implanted
in my heart a perfect faith, so that I believe in Thee as the true God, and in Thy
prophets as true prophets; Thou hast not cast my lot among those that rebel against
Thee, or among those who provoke Thy name, despise Thy Law, attack Thy servants, and
disbelieve Thy prophets.” Knowledge—philosophy and science—is the very essence, the
immortal element of the soul, and yet without the Word of God man would go astray
and be lost.
</p>
<p id="faith.dunash">The boundaries between faith and reason are more distinctly set forth in the Commentary
on Sefer Yetsirah by Dunash ben Tamim (ed. L. Dukes in <i>Shire Shelomoh</i>, i. p. vi. <i>seq.</i>): “All these beings above and below have been created by God, and it is within the
province of man to explore and to examine all of them; but he must not pass beyond
these boundaries to investigate into the essence of God; ‘for in the city of his refuge
shall he dwell,’ and ‘if he goeth out of his place, and the avenger of blood smite
him, he hath no remedy.’ Besides, wisdom and science acknowledge that man is unable
to comprehend by his own intellect anything that exists outside the sphere of created
beings.”
</p>
<p id="faith.bachya">R. Bachya, son of Joseph hassephardi, who lived in the eleventh century, treats, in
the Introduction to his “Duties of the Heart,” of the three sources of human knowledge—Holy
Writ, Tradition, and Reason. Bachya is fully convinced that the knowledge derived
from the first two sources is complete and correct. “If you are a man endowed with
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>knowledge and reason, and are able to demonstrate the principles of your belief and
your religious practice, which you have been taught by the Sages in the name of the
prophets, it is your duty to do so, and to let reason confirm what Tradition teaches.
If you abstain from attempting this investigation, you neglect your duty towards your
Creator.”
</p>
<p id="faith.shemtob">Still more emphatic is Shem-tob ibn Palqera in demanding the right of free inquiry
into everything taught by Revelation and Tradition. In a dialogue between the believer
and the inquirer (<i>Hammebhakkesh</i>) the former is represented as ignorant of everything our mind desires to know; whilst
the wise man, who combines belief and confidence in Tradition with the right use of
his reason, knows how to satisfy the inquirer, and lays down the rule, “Let the study
of the Torah be the foundation, and the study of other things secondary; believe nothing
that is not proved by reason or by God” (<i>i.e.</i>, by the word of Revelation).
</p>
<p id="faith.bendavid">R. Abraham ben David, in <i>Emunah ramah</i>: “Because three out of four scholars (R. Akiba, Ben-azai, Ben-zoma, and Elisha) were
unsuccessful in their philosophical researches, therefore many turn their backs upon
science, and in consequence of this neglect they remain ignorant of the chief principles
of our religion.” The object of his book is to reconcile religion and science.
</p>
<p id="faith.hallevi">R. Judah hallevi, in his “Kuzari,” endeavours to convince the Kuzarite king of the
truth of the Jewish religion by philosophical arguments, but gives unhesitatingly
the preference and the higher authority to Divine revelation. He is convinced that
reason or <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>philosophical argument could never refute any principle taught in the Law. He says:
“Prophecy is certainly stronger than logical inference.”
</p>
<p id="faith.ezra">R. Abraham ibn Ezra believes that man’s intellectual faculties are insufficient to
solve all transcendental problems; thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the nature of the spirit of man is unknown to most, and is only comprehended by
him “whose thoughts are weighed in the balance of reason, and are established on the
four elements of wisdom, viz., the three R’s: reading, writing, and reckoning; (in
Hebrew, the three <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ס‎</span>: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סְפָר סֵפֶר סִפּוּר‎</span>) and the Divine Law.” Ibn Ezra recommends the study of science, united with the belief
in Divine revelation. “The Torah,” Ibn Ezra remarks in his Commentary on Ps. xix.
8, “is perfect in itself; it requires no evidence from without for the truths which
it teaches.”
</p>
<p id="faith.maimonides">Maimonides’ “Guide to the Perplexed” is entirely devoted to the problem how to reconcile
Scripture and reason. Scripture cannot contain anything contrary to reason; nor can
the result of scientific research and philosophical speculation be conceived as contrary
to reason, which is their very basis. But where any such contradiction is perceived,
<i>we</i> are at fault either in our reasoning or in our interpretation of the Divine Writings.
The Incorporeality and Unity of God are doctrines that have been fully proved, and
Scripture cannot teach anything that is contrary to them. Where we believe them to
be contradicted in the Holy Writings the contradiction is only apparent, and by assuming
an allegorical use of words and phrases the seeming contradiction is removed.
</p>
<p id="faith.albo">R. Joseph Albo prefaces his book on the principles <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>of Judaism as follows: “As the human understanding is incapable of finding out what
is true and what is good, there must be a higher Being that assists us in determining
what is good and in comprehending what is true. It is therefore necessary, above all,
to study and to know the divine Law that guides man in these problems.”
</p>
<p id="faith.medigo">R. Eliah del Medigo, in his <i>Bechinath haddath</i> (Examination of Religion) says as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Let us first see whether or not the study of philosophy is permitted to the followers
of our religion; and, if it be permitted, whether the study is to be considered a
duty and a laudable act. The right-minded Jew does not doubt that the Law aims at
leading us to humane conduct, good deeds, and true knowledge, the common people according
to their capacity, and the more gifted according to their abilities. Certain fundamental
truths are therefore set forth in the Law and the Prophets in an authoritative, poetical,
or dialectical style; but the higher order of intellects are encouraged to search
for proper proofs. Thus the whole nation is addressed by Isaiah: ‘Lift up your eyes
on high and see who hath created these,’ and the like. Also the chief of the Prophets
tells the Israelites: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is One.’ Those
who are more highly endowed than their fellow-men are exhorted, either directly or
indirectly, to follow the course which is suitable to them. The direct exhortation
to philosophical research is contained in the words: ‘<i>Know</i> then this day, and take it to thy heart, that the Lord He is God,’ &amp;c.; and indirectly
it is contained in the commandment <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>to love and to fear God, as has been explained by R. Moses Maimonides.—The study of
science will certainly be of use to the scholar; it leads to a knowledge of the created
things, and through these to a knowledge of the Creator. Such study may even be considered
as <i>necessary</i> to the Jewish scholar, though not to the ordinary Jew. The scholar must, however,
not entirely rely on his research, but on that which is taught in the Law. In this
the scholar and the ordinary man are equal, that both accept the teaching of the Torah
as infallible; only with this difference, that the scholar can in addition satisfy
his thirst for knowledge and confirm by scientific proof what he has already accepted
as true on the authority of the Bible.”
</p>
<p id="faith.mendelssohn">Of modern scholars I only quote Moses Mendelssohn’s theory. He accepts unconditionally
the teaching of the Bible; all its truths are absolute and perfect; no reasoning whatever
can refute them; but difficulties may sometimes present themselves to us in reconciling
the teaching of the Bible with that of our reason. What have we then to do? The philosopher
declares: “If I were to find my reason in contradiction to the Word of God, I could
command reason to be silent; but the arguments, so long as they have not been refuted,
will nevertheless assert themselves in the innermost recesses of my heart; the arguments
will assume the form of disquieting doubts, which will resolve themselves into childlike
prayers, earnest supplication for enlightenment. I should utter the words of the Psalmist:
‘Lord, send me Thy light, Thy truth, that they may <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>guide me, and bring me to Thy holy mount, to Thy dwelling-place!’ ”
</p>
<p>The conception which Moses Mendelssohn had of Jewish belief and its relation to reason
we learn from the following passage:—“I recognise no other eternal truths than those
which are not only comprehensible to the human mind, but also demonstrable by human
powers. This principle by no means brings me into conflict with my own religion; on
the contrary, I consider it an essential element in Judaism, and the characteristic
difference between Judaism and Christianity. Judaism has no revealed religion in the
sense in which Christianity has. The Jews have a revealed legislation which instructs
them in the divinely ordained means by which they may attain the eternal bliss. Laws
and rules for conduct in life were revealed to Moses in a supernatural way, but no
doctrines, no saving truth, and no general laws of logic. The latter the Eternal reveals
to us, as to all men, through nature and through the things themselves; never through
words and letters. The divine book revealed to Moses, though a book of laws, includes
an inexhaustible treasure of truths and doctrines.… The more we study it the more
we wonder at the depth of the knowledge contained in it. But these truths are taught,
and not forced upon us as dogmas. Belief does not allow itself to be commanded; it
is based upon conviction. In the Hebrew language, the very word which is generally
translated ‘faith,’ viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span> denotes originally confidence, trust that the promise made will also be fulfilled,
and not what we understand by ‘religious faith.’ ”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>These words of Mendelssohn show how greatly those err who quote his opinions in support
of the dictum that Judaism recognises no dogmas. According to Mendelssohn, Judaism
does not consist entirely of laws; it teaches also certain truths. We have certain
dogmas without which the laws can have no meaning, yet there is no precept, “Thou
shalt believe.” Nowhere in our Law, whether written or oral, is <i>a solemn declaration of our creed</i> demanded. In so far Mendelssohn’s view is correct; but when he believes that all
the truths we are taught in Scripture can be made evident by logical demonstration
he is mistaken. As to the meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span> comp. <i>supra</i>, p. 4.

<div id="ch1.principles" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e373">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">THE THIRTEEN PRINCIPLES <br>OF <br>OUR CREED.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The main source of our creed is the Bible, and among the Biblical books, chiefly the
Pentateuch (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה‎</span>). In these books we find many truths taught by God Himself, or by His inspired messengers,
and they form the substance of our creed. It matters little how we arrange them, how
we collect them into groups, and subdivide these again, provided we believe in them
implicitly. In the Bible they are not arranged systematically; they are intermingled
with, and are contained implicitly in, the history and the laws that form the subject-matter
of the Scriptures; it is the observance of those laws which constitutes the best evidence
of the belief seated in the heart. No declaration or recital of a creed is commanded
in the Pentateuch; no tribunal is appointed for inquiring whether the belief of a
man is right or wrong; no punishment is inflicted or threatened for want of belief.
It became, however, necessary to formulate the truths taught in the Bible, when disputes
arose as to their meaning and to their validity. The Mishnah, therefore, declares
certain opinions as un-Jewish and contrary to the teaching of the Divine Word. Later
on, when controversies <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>multiplied between the various sections of the Jewish nation, as well as between Jews
and Christians and Jews and Mohammedans, it was found most important to settle the
form and arrangement of our beliefs. Moses Maimonides, the great religious philosopher,
taught, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, thirteen principles of faith, which found
general acceptance among the Jews, and are known as the Thirteen Principles. They
have found their way into the Prayer-book in two different forms, one in prose and
one in poetry. Maimonides, in commending them to the reader, says: “Read them again
and again and study them well, and let not your heart entice you to believe that you
have comprehended their full meaning after having read them a few times; you would
then be in a great error, for I have not written down what occurred to my mind at
first thought. I first thoroughly studied and examined what I was going to write,
compared the various doctrines, the correct ones and the incorrect ones, and when
I arrived at what we ought to accept as our creed, I was able to prove it by arguments
and reasoning.” The thirteen articles as put forth by Maimonides, and called by him
principles and foundations of our religion, are the following:—
</p>
<p>1. The first principle: The belief in the existence of the Creator; that is, the belief
that there exists a Being who requires no other cause for His existence, but is Himself
the cause of all beings.
</p>
<p>2. The second principle: The belief in the Unity of God; that is, the belief that
the Being who is the cause of everything in existence is One; not like the unity of
a group or class, composed of a certain <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>number of individuals, or the unity of one individual consisting of various constituent
elements, or the unity of one simple thing which is divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>, but as a unity the like of which does not exist.
</p>
<p>3. The third principle: The belief in the Incorporeality of God; that is, the belief
that this One Creator has neither bodily form nor substance, that He is not a force
contained in a body, and that no corporeal quality or action can be attributed to
Him.
</p>
<p>4. The fourth principle: The belief in the Eternity of God; that is, the belief that
God alone is without a beginning, whilst no other being is without a beginning.
</p>
<p>5. The fifth principle: The belief that the Creator alone is to be worshipped, and
no other being, whether angel, star, or ought else, all these being themselves creatures.
</p>
<p>6. The sixth principle: The belief in Prophecy; that is, the belief that there have
been men endowed with extraordinary moral and intellectual powers, by which they were
enabled to reach a degree and kind of knowledge unattainable to others.
</p>
<p>7. The seventh principle: The belief that our teacher Moses was the greatest of all
prophets, both those before him and those after him.
</p>
<p>8. The eighth principle: The belief in the Divine origin of the Law; the belief that
the whole Pentateuch was communicated to Moses by God, both the precepts and the historical
accounts contained therein.
</p>
<p>9. The ninth principle: The belief in the integrity of the Law; that both the written
and the oral Law are of Divine origin, and that nothing may be added to it or taken
from it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>10. The tenth principle: The belief that God knows and notices the deeds and thoughts
of man.
</p>
<p>11. The eleventh principle: The belief that God rewards those who perform the commandments
of His Law, and punishes those who transgress them.
</p>
<p>12. The twelfth principle: The belief that Messiah will come at some future time,
which it is impossible for us to determine; that he will be of the house of David,
and will be endowed with extraordinary wisdom and power.
</p>
<p>13. The thirteenth principle: The belief in the revival of the dead, or the immortality
of the soul.
</p>
<p>These thirteen principles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלשה עשר עקרים‎</span>) may be divided into three groups, according to their relation to the three principles:—1.
Existence of God. 2. Revelation. 3. Reward and punishment. The first group includes
the first five principles, the second the next four, and the third the remaining four.
In this order they will now be considered.
</p>
<div id="ch1.1" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e382">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> <i>Existence of God</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מציאות הבורא‎</span>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The notion of the existence of God, of an invisible power which exercises its influence
in everything that is going on in nature, is widespread, and common to almost the
whole human race. It is found among all civilised nations and many uncivilised tribes.
The existence of God may be regarded as an innate idea, which we possess from our
earliest days. This is the origin of Natural Religion. Thinkers of all ages and nations
have attempted to confirm this innate idea by convincing arguments. Prophets and divine
poets <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>have frequently directed the attention of those whom they addressed to the marvels
of nature in order to inspire them with the idea of an All-wise and All-powerful Creator.
</p>
<p>“Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these? Who is He who bringeth
them forth by number? All of them He calleth by name, by the greatness of His might,
and for that He is strong in power, not one is lacking” (Isa. xl. 26). “The heavens
declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handywork” (Ps. xix. 2).
</p>
<p>The regularity in the rising and setting of the heavenly bodies, which enables us
to foretell the exact time and duration of an eclipse of the sun or the moon, is certainly
a strong argument for the belief that there is a mighty and wise Creator who fixed
the laws in accordance with which these luminaries move.
</p>
<p>“Beautiful are the luminaries which our God has created. He has formed them with knowledge,
reason, and understanding; He endowed them with power and strength to rule in the
midst of the world. Full of splendour and beaming with light, they illumine the whole
world; they rejoice when they rise, they are glad when they set, doing in reverence
the will of their Master” (Sabbath Morning Service).
</p>
<p>A similar regularity we notice when looking on the face of the earth. The various
seasons of the year, each with its peculiar aspect and influence, the sequence of
day and night at regular intervals, the gradual and systematic development of vegetable
and animal life—all point forcibly to the fact that these <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>things do not owe their existence to chance, but to the will of an Almighty and All-wise
Creator.
</p>
<p>Again, if we consider the structure of a single plant, or of a single animal, we find
that every one of the members and parts of which it is composed has its peculiar function
or purpose in the economy of the whole plant or the whole animal. Let one of these
component parts refuse its function or cease to fulfil its purpose and the whole is
disorganised. Certainly there must be a Being who makes the different members of an
organism co-operate for the development and advantage of the whole. The idea of purpose
which regulates this co-operation cannot have originated in the parts nor in the whole,
but in the conception of Him by whose Will these were created.
</p>
<p>“The finger of God” is further recognised in the important events of the life of the
individual as well as in the history of whole nations. We are frequently reminded
of the lesson, “The heart of man deviseth his way, but the Lord directeth his step”
(Prov. xvi. 9). “Salvation is the Lord’s, and on Thy people it is incumbent to bless
Thee” (Ps. iii. 9).
</p>
<p>Another argument in support of the belief in the existence of God is taken from the
moral consciousness which every human being possesses. This points to the existence
of a higher Being, perfect in goodness, as the origin and cause of the moral consciousness
in our own heart.
</p>
<p>These and similar arguments are employed to strengthen and purify our belief in God.
The question, however, arises, <span class="corr" id="xd32e2918" title="Source: Are">are</span> these arguments alone sufficient <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>to convince us? Are they strong enough to resist the attacks of scepticism?
</p>
<p>On examining them thoroughly we shall find them of excellent service to the believer.
His belief is strengthened against many doubts by which he may be assailed; and scepticism
will be kept at bay by these arguments. But of themselves and unsupported they may
not always suffice to establish belief in God; and if they carry conviction with them
for the moment, we are not sure whether fresh arguments of opponents might not again
unsettle the mind. Another method was therefore chosen by the Almighty, by which certainty
is attained, and a sure guide is given for our moral and religious life. It is <i>Revelation</i>. Of this we shall speak later on.
</p>
<p>The principal forms of religion or worship that sprang from the natural belief in
God are Polytheism, Pantheism, Atheism, Theism, and Deism.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.0.1">1. The first form of Divine worship of which history and archæology give us information
is <i>Polytheism</i>. The creating and ruling power of some invisible Being was noticed everywhere. Every
manifestation of such influence was ascribed to its peculiar deity, which was worshipped
according to the peculiar conception of the deity in the mind of the individual person,
family, or nation. This is chiefly the kind of idolatry mentioned in the Bible and
combated by the prophets.
</p>
<p>A very general object of worship were the stars. Rabbi Jehudah ha-Levi, in Kuzari
iv. 1, in trying to explain the origin of this practice, says as follows:—“The spheres
of the sun and the moon do not move in the same way. A separate cause or god was therefore
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>assumed for each, and people did not think that there was a higher force on which
all these causes depended.” The ancient monuments and the treasures stored up in our
museums show how great was the variety of forms which idolatry took, and to how great
an extent people adhered, and still adhere, to this kind of worship. But there have
been thinkers and philosophers even among the idolatrous nations who sought a unity
in the construction and working of the universe, and early arrived at the idea of
a First Cause as the sole source of all that exists.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.0.2">2. The fact that the influence of the Divine power makes itself perceptible to the
observing eye of man everywhere produced another kind of human error: Pantheism (All-God).
Modern Pantheism dates from Spinoza; but long before Spinoza, when the secret forces
at work in the changes noticed by us in all material objects were recognised as properties
inherent in the substance of things, these forces were considered as the sole independent
causes of the existing universe, and the combination of these forces, called Nature,
was considered to be the First Cause, or God. A modification of this theory is contained
in the philosophy of Spinoza. According to this great philosopher’s system, the universe
in its entirety has the attributes of the Deity: there exists nothing but the Substance
(God), its attributes, and the various ways in which these attributes become perceptible
to man. Spinoza tried to defend himself from the reproach of describing God as corporeal,
but he did not succeed. The attribute of extension or space which God possesses, according
to Spinoza, is only conceivable <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>in relation to corporeal things. The philosophy of Spinoza is in this dilemma: either
God is corporeal, or the corporeal world does not exist. Both assumptions are equally
absurd. It is true, in one of his letters he complains that he has been misrepresented,
as if he believed God to consist of a certain corporeal mass. But we cannot help assuming
the existence of a certain corporeal mass, and if this is not God, we must distinguish
in our mind God and something that is not God, contrary to the fundamental doctrine
of Pantheism. Besides, there are many incongruities and improbabilities involved in
this theory. It has no foundation for a moral consciousness. The wicked and the good
are alike inseparable from God. They both result with necessity from the attributes
of God, and they cannot be otherwise than they actually are. If we, by the consideration
that injury done to us by our fellow-man was not done by that person alone, but by
a series of predetermined necessary causes, may be induced to conquer hatred against
the apparent cause of our injury, we may equally be induced by the same reasoning
to consider the kindness and benefits of our friends not worthy of gratitude, believing
that they were <i>compelled</i> to act in this manner, and could not act otherwise.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.0.3">3. Pantheism, by teaching All in One and One in All, is opposed to the theory of man’s
responsibility to a higher Being, denies the existence of God in the ordinary sense
of the word, and is, in its relation to true religion, equal to atheism.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.0.4">In the Bible atheism is stigmatised as the source of all evils. Thus the patriarch
Abraham suspected the <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>people of Gerar, that there was “no fear of God” in the place, and was afraid “they
might slay him” (Gen. xx. 11); whilst Joseph persuaded his brothers to have confidence
in him by the assertion, “I fear God” (<i>Ib.</i> xlii. 18). The first instance of an atheist we meet in Pharaoh, king of Egypt, when
he defiantly said, “I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go” (Exod. v. 2).
Another form of atheism is warned against in the words of Moses: “Lest thou sayest
in thine heart, My strength and the power of my hand has got for me all this wealth”
(Deut. viii. 17); and “Lest they say, Our hand is high, and it is not the Lord that
hath done all this” (<i>Ib.</i> xxxii. 27). The prophets likewise rebuke the people for want of belief in God. In
the Psalms, the crimes and evil designs of oppressors are traced to godlessness. “The
wicked says in his heart, There is no God” (Ps. xiv. 1). But this atheism of the Bible
is not a theoretical or dogmatic one; it is not the result of thought, or of deep
inquiry into the causes of things, but merely the voice of an evil inclination which
tempts man to act contrary to the command of God, and assures him of immunity, under
the impression that his actions are not watched by a higher authority. In post-Biblical
literature we meet with the phrase, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לית דִּין ולית דַּיָּן‎</span> “There is no judgment, and there is no judge,” as the basis of atheism.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.0.5">4. Although the conviction of man’s responsibility to a higher authority is the essential
element in the belief in God, yet the notion of godlessness was so intimately connected
with crime and wickedness, that those who rejected the authority and mastership of
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>Deity refused to be called godless or atheists. Many philosophers retained the name
“God” (<i>theos</i>, <i>deus</i>) for their “First Cause” of the universe, although it is deprived of the chief attributes
of God. Thus we have as the principal religious theories resulting from philosophical
investigations, Theism and Deism. Literally these two terms denote, Theory of God,
or Belief in God; the one word being derived from the Greek <i>theos</i>, the other from the Latin <i>deus</i>, both meaning “God.”
</p>
<p>There is, however, an essential difference between the two theories. Theism and Deism
have this in common, that both assume a spiritual power, a divine being, as the cause
and source of everything that exists. They differ in this: to Theism this power is
immanent in us and the things round us; Deism considers this power as separate from
the things. Revelation or prophecy is altogether denied by the Deists, whilst the
Theists would accept it after their own fashion and rationalise it.
</p>
<p>All these various systems of religion have this in common, that they attempt to remove
from religion everything that cannot be comprehended by human reason. But all attempts
to substitute human reason for Divine authority have failed. A limit has been set
to human reason, and that cannot be overcome. In every system of religion—the natural
and the rational included—there is a mystic element, which may be enveloped in a mist
of phrases, but remains unexplained. Whether we call the Creator and Ruler of the
universe God, Deus, or Theos, His relation to the universe, and to man in particular,
cannot be <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>determined by the laws which determine the natural phenomena in the universe, created
by His Will.
</p>
<p>What is our conception of the Deity? The fundamental idea, from which all our notions
concerning God are derived, and which we have in common with all other believers in
God, is that He is the First Cause, the Creator of the universe. This idea expressed
in the term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הבורא יתברך שמו‎</span> forms the basis of our creed. It is the Creator that is described in it. Seven of
the articles begin, “I believe with a perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His
name,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>We do not use the term “First Cause,” because it is too narrow; it only expresses
part of the truth, not the whole of it. By “First Cause” some understand the cause
of the gradual development of the primitive matter into the innumerable variety of
things contained in the universe; the development of the original chaos into system
and order. It is true that the Creator is the cause of all this; but He is more than
this: He is the cause of the primitive matter, and of the original chaos. For He has
created the world out of nothing. The first verse of the Bible teaches us creation
from nothing (<i lang="la">creatio ex nihilo</i>): “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (Gen. i. 1); that is, the
whole universe. It is true that there were men who explained the meaning of the Hebrew
root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברא‎</span> in a different manner, and desired to assign to it the meaning: cutting out, forming
out of a given material. But they certainly misunderstood the spirit of the Scriptures.
The eternal coexistence of God and matter would imply a dualism utterly incompatible
with the teaching of the Bible. The frequently repeated declaration, “He is our God;
there <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>is none besides” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין עוד‎</span>), clearly excludes every form of dualism. Those who assert that the universe could
not come from nothing belong to the class of people of whom the Psalmist says, “And
they returned and tempted God, and set limits to the Holy One of Israel” (Ps. lxxviii.
41).
</p>
<p>If we cannot understand the act of the Creation, it is our own intellect that is limited;
and if we were to persuade ourselves that we understand better the eternity of matter,
we should deceive ourselves. We cannot conceive matter without form as existing in
reality, nor can we have a clear notion of anything infinite. We are human beings,
endowed by the will and wisdom of the Creator with limited physical and intellectual
faculties, and in things that surpass our powers we cannot do better than follow the
guidance of the Divine Word. If we do so we may be sure that we shall be on the right
way to truth.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.1">The first principle declared in our creed is this: God is not only the Creator of
the heavens and the earth, with all their hosts; He is also the constant ruler of
all created beings; He is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בורא ומנהיג‎</span>. We therefore praise Him in our daily Morning prayer as “Doing wonders; renewing
in His goodness the work of the creation every day.” When we observe the ordinary
phenomena in nature, occurring in accordance with certain fixed laws which have been
discovered and described by man, we see in them the greatness of the Creator by whose
will these laws are still in force, and by whose will any or all of these laws may
one day cease to continue.
</p>
<p>It has been asserted that any interruption or change <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>of these fixed laws would indicate a weakness and want of foresight on the part of
the Creator, and a fault in the plan of the Creation. This notion has led people either
to deny the truth of the Biblical accounts concerning the miracles wrought by the
Almighty, or to admit the correctness of the facts while denying their miraculous
character, or to consider the fixed laws of nature, together with their exceptions,
as designed in the original plan of the Creation. How short-sighted is man! He cannot
even fully comprehend his own short-sightedness! God made him ruler over the works
of His hands, and he presumes to be the ruler of God Himself! When we learn from numerous
observations and experiments the law that seems to regulate certain recurring phenomena,
have we then fathomed the infinite wisdom of God in the Creation? Do we know the reason
which led Him to produce certain things according to certain laws, and not otherwise?
Have we in discovering a law of nature obtained the power of prescribing the same
law to God, and disallowing Him to deviate therefrom? Far be it from us human beings,
dust and ashes, to arrogate to ourselves such a right! It may even be one of the objects
with which miracles were wrought to teach us that we do not yet know all things, that
events may happen which we are unable to foresee, that phenomena may appear which
we are unable to explain according to the laws hitherto discovered; in short, that
our knowledge and wisdom are limited.
</p>
<p>The fact that God has created the universe <i lang="la">ex nihilo</i> has been expressed by Jewish philosophers as follows:—God is the only Being who demands
no cause for His existence; the very idea of God implies existence, <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>and cannot be conceived without it. All other beings owe their existence to certain
causes, in the absence of which they would not exist. God alone is therefore only
active, without ever being passive, only cause without ever being effect, whilst every
other being is both active and passive, cause and effect; it has been produced by
certain causes, and is in its turn the cause of the existence of other beings. In
the first article a phrase expressing this idea has been added: “And He alone is the
active cause of <i>all</i> things, whether past, present, or future.” By the addition of this sentence it was
intended to deny the Eternity of matter (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדמות העולם‎</span>). The reference to past, present, and future is to emphasise the constant action
of the Creator, and the dependence of the natural forces on His Will. The first principle
has, therefore, the following form:—
</p>
<p>“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His name, is both Creator and Ruler
of all created beings, and that He alone is the active cause of</i> <span class="sc">ALL</span> <i>things, whether past, present, or future.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3023src" href="#xd32e3023">1</a>
</p>
<p>Before passing on to the second principle concerning God, let us briefly answer a
question that has frequently been asked: What is the relation between the theory of
evolution, or in general the results of modern science, and the history of the creation
as related in the Bible? In the Biblical account of the creation the various kinds
of plants and animals are described as the result or different and distinct acts of
the Creator, whilst according to the theory of Evolution one creative act sufficed,
and the great variety of creatures is the result <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>of gradual development according to certain laws inherent in the things created. The
Bible tells us of six days of the creation, whilst according to the theory of evolution
it must have taken millions of years before the various species could have developed
the one from the other. Whilst the Biblical account describes the earth as the centre
of the universe, astronomy shows that the earth is one of the most insignificant of
the bodies that fill the infinite space of the universe. According to astronomy and
geology, the age of the earth numbers millions of years; from the Biblical account
we infer that the earth is comparatively young. In the Bible man is described as the
aim and end of the whole creation; natural history and the theory of evolution consider
man simply as one of the forms resulting from a natural development of the animal
world. What shall be our decision in this discrepancy? Shall we shut our eyes to the
results of modern science in our firm belief in the truth of the Bible? Or shall we
accept the former and abandon the latter?
</p>
<p>We should adopt neither of these alternatives. We have great confidence in our reasoning
power, and in the results of science based on reason, but we have still greater confidence
in the truthfulness of Divine teaching. The conflict is not a modern product; it existed
in former times as well. When the Jews first became acquainted with Greek literature
and philosophy, faith was shaken in the heart of many a Jew that was led away by the
attractive language and the persuasive arguments of the Greek. Such was the case with
the Jews in Alexandria, who were almost <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>more Greek than Jewish. Feeling that their faith in their old traditions was beginning
to give way, they looked about them for the means of reconciling faith and philosophy.
Where the literal sense of Holy Writ was awkward, the allegorical interpretation was
substituted for it; but the authority of the Bible was recognised. Later on, in the
Middle Ages, when Aristotle, as understood and interpreted in the Arabic schools,
was infallible, perplexity again became general, among the educated and learned, as
to the course to be pursued in case of a conflict; whether to remain true to the Bible
or to join the banner of Aristotle. The most prominent amongst the Jewish theologians
who sought the way of reconciliation was Moses Maimonides. This philosopher wrote
his famous work, “Guide of the Perplexed,” expressly for those scholars who, whilst
firmly adhering to the inherited faith, had been trained in the study of philosophy,
and were unwilling to abandon either. Maimonides shows the way how to explain Biblical
passages implying statements contrary to philosophical teachings, and how to reconcile
theology and philosophy. A similar task was undertaken in modern times by Moses Mendelssohn
in his “Jerusalem” and “<span lang="de">Morgenstunden</span>,” in order to show that strict adherence to the Jewish religion is quite compatible
with the teaching of philosophy. The various systems of philosophy in Alexandria,
in the Mohammedan countries in the Middle Ages, and in Germany in the last century,
which threatened to endanger our religion, have lived their time and have gone to
their fathers, giving way to new systems and new ideas, whilst the authority of the
Word of God <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>has maintained its place. This having been the case in former days, there is no reason
why we should not in the present conflict assume, <i lang="la">primâ facie</i>, that the scientific and philosophical dogmas now in favour, alike with Jews and
non-Jews, will have their time, and will ultimately give way to other theories, and
the present conflict will then likewise terminate, dying a natural death. This reflection
should put us on our guard lest we be persuaded by the plausibility of the modern
philosophical and scientific dogmas, and throw aside our religious faith and traditions.
We ought to bear in mind that, however correct the conclusions of modern science may
appear that can be tested by our senses, theories which are not subject to such tests
are in reality nothing but hypotheses to which a greater or lesser degree of probability
attaches.
</p>
<p>Suppose now—always bearing in mind the imperfect character of our powers of observation—we
were to observe that certain plants or species of animals developed by training and
circumstances into new species, or to see plants being transformed into animals, or
even to notice literally “the foal of a wild ass born a man,” what would all this
prove? That the Creator endowed the species of plants and animals with such properties
as would enable them to transform into new species, or into any other of the species
already in existence; but it does not follow that the Creator must have adopted the
same method in the act of creation. He created as many species as His wisdom determined,
although they might all have been able to develop from one single species. Suppose
the problem which the Alchymists of the Middle Ages proposed <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>to themselves, viz., to produce an animal being by mere chemical combination, had
actually been solved, would any one have believed that all animals had been produced
in that way? Or does the success of artificial hatching of eggs convince any person
that all birds have sprung from artificially hatched eggs? The same argument applies
to the geological formation of the earth. We notice changes brought about through
natural forces, and mark the amount of change effected in a certain period; we are
then able to calculate what time would be required for such or such a change—provided
that only those laws be in force which we have noticed in our calculation. Is it reasonable
or logical to apply to the act of creation the laws which have been brought into force
through this very act? “He said, and it was: He commanded, and they were created”
(Ps. xxxiii. 9). The word of God produced in a moment what the natural forces established
by the Creator would effect by gradual development in millions of years.
</p>
<p>It is true that the earth is one of the most insignificant bodies in the universe,
and man is a small portion of the creatures on earth, and yet it is neither impossible
nor unreasonable to believe that the benefits which man derives from the various parts
of the creation, from the sun, the moon, and the stars, were essential elements in
the scheme of the All-wise Creator.
</p>
<p>Attempts have frequently been made to interpret the Biblical account of the creation
in such a manner as to reconcile it with the scientific theories of the time. Thus
it has been argued that the period between the <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>creation of “heaven and earth” and the creation of “the light” is not described in
the Bible, and may have been millions of millions of years. It has likewise been suggested
that the term “day” is to be understood in the sense of “period.” It has further been
pointed out that the account of the creation of animals indicates a process of development
rather than a <i lang="la">creatio ex nihilo</i>; for it says, “And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly living beings,”
&amp;c. (Gen. i. 20). “Let the earth bring forth living beings,” &amp;c. (<i>Ibid.</i> 24). These interpretations may be true, and may suffice temporarily to check sceptical
ideas that rise in our mind; but without the firm belief in the Word of God, and the
consciousness of the insufficiency of human reason thoroughly to understand the plans
and ways of God, our faith can never be safe. Supported by this belief we shall always
be able to brave the ever-recurring billows of scepticism.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.2">2. The next principle contained in our Creed concerning God is <i>the Unity of God</i>.
</p>
<p>“I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out from the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage: thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exod. xx. 2–3). This is the
first lesson the Israelites were taught when God revealed Himself to them on Mount
Sinai. The words, “Hear, O Israel; the Lord is our God, the Lord is One” (Deut. vi.
4), are proclaimed by us thrice every day; we recite them when we rise; keep them
in memory during the day, and repeat them in the evening before we go to rest; they
form our watchword throughout our life, and with these <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>words upon our lips we end our earthly existence. The Unity of God is the doctrine
that distinguishes the Jews from other religious sects, in so far as the Jews were
the first nation of Monotheists. From them Monotheism has spread among other peoples,
who, however, did not always receive or preserve it in its original purity. We not
only proclaim God as One, refusing to recognise as divine any power beside Him, but
refrain also from attributing to God anything that might directly or indirectly involve
any notion contrary to the Unity of God.
</p>
<p>For this reason certain Jewish philosophers considered it unlawful to assign to God
any positive attribute. They feared this might lead to dualism, to believe in God
and in His attribute as two distinct beings, because attributes are so easily personified
and addressed as separate deities. Some theologians even were of opinion that the
admission of God’s attributes is itself a form of dualism which must be excluded from
our faith. Nevertheless, attributes are assigned to God both in the Scriptures and
in our Prayers. We must not, however, forget that such attributes do not describe
anything inherent in the Divine Being, but only God’s relation to man and His actions
in such terms as are intelligible to human beings. Most of the attributes are interpreted
as being of a negative character, indicating what we must not say of God. When we
speak of the Will, Wisdom, and Spirit of God, we do not speak of anything separate
from the Divine Being, but of the Divine Being Himself. The Jewish doctrine of the
Unity of God does not admit any kind of dualism in the Divine Being, and therefore
rejects <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>the existence of Divine Attributes as distinct from God Himself. He is One, simple
and indivisible. Even this property of being One seemed to some theologians to be
contrary to strict unity, and we are therefore taught that we must not understand
it in the sense of a numerical unit, in which sense the term is used when applied
to created beings. The second article therefore declares: “The Creator is One, and
there is no Oneness like His in any way.”
</p>
<p>The Unity of God is the creed which the Jews have always proclaimed by word of mouth,
to which they have given expression throughout their literature, and for which they
have willingly sacrificed their lives as martyrs. When persecuted by Mohammedans or
Christians the Jews were frequently forced to break the Sabbath, to ignore the dietary
laws, and to neglect Divine worship. They bore all this patiently when under pressure
of persecution, but when they were asked to renounce the belief in God’s Unity they
did not doubt for a moment as to what their duty was; they adhered firmly to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יחוד השם‎</span> “the belief in God’s Unity,” and sacrificed their lives for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדוש השם‎</span> “the sanctification of God’s name.”
</p>
<p>The Jews have been victorious. In spite of persecution and oppression they have maintained
their faith. The doctrine of the Unity of God, for which they had to suffer so much
in past centuries, is now admitted as true by most of their former persecutors.
</p>
<p>In order to make clear what we mean by unity, and to express that God could not be
conceived as existing at any time in a double form, we add the words: “And <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>He alone was, is, and will be our God.” The second article runs therefore as follows:—
</p>
<p>“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His name, is One; that there is no Oneness
like His, in any way, and that He alone was, is, and will be our God.</i>”
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.3">3. The strict Unity of God, in the sense explained above, implies His <i>Incorporeality</i>, which forms the subject of the third article. Corporeality implies substance and
form, a dualism which must be rigidly excluded from God. It would not have been necessary
to formulate a special article for the exclusion of corporeality from the idea of
God but for the fact that many erroneous notions have been entertained on the subject.
Besides the fact that the corporeality of God was assumed by certain religious sects,
there have been scholars among the Jews who defended the literal sense of anthropomorphic
phrases in the Scriptures.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.3.1">In the Bible anthropomorphic expressions are employed in order to illustrate the different
acts of Divine Providence in such a way as to render them more intelligible to us
human beings. We consist of body and soul, and we produce an impression or exercise
an influence on others by means of our body and by the activity of our bodily organs.
How an incorporeal being acts upon the corporeal world we are unable fully to comprehend,
much less to describe. If we desire to picture to ourselves or to others the fact
that through Divine Providence something has been produced on earth, we must employ
the same phrases which we use in describing human acts which effect <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>a similar result. In reality, however, there is no comparison or similarity between
God and corporeal beings, between His actions and ours.
</p>
<p>When we therefore speak of the house of God we mean the house which we devote to our
prayers, in which we feel the omnipresence of the Almighty more than in any other
place. The heaven is called the throne of God and the earth His footstool only to
express the idea that the majesty of God is far beyond comparison with that of any
earthly ruler, and that the house of God built by human hands is not intended to satisfy
the requirements of the Supreme Being but those of man. We call Him our Father and
He calls us His children, because we love Him as we love our father, and He loves
us as a father loves his children. In the same sense the Psalmist (ii. 7) repeats
the words of God to him, “Thou art my son; I have this day begotten thee.” Such expressions
as these are anthropomorphic.
</p>
<p>The Bible frequently exhorts us not to imagine or ascribe to God any form or likeness.
Comp. Deut. iv. 15, “Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of form on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of fire.”
In the same sense the prophet asks in the name of God (Isa. xl. 18), “To whom then
will you liken God, or what likeness will you compare unto Him?” “To whom then will
you liken Me, that I should be equal to Him? saith the Holy One” (<i>Ibid.</i> 25).
</p>
<p>We declare therefore in the third article:—
</p>
<p>“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>name, is not a body, that corporeal relations do not apply to Him, and that there
exists nothing that is in any way similar to Him.</i>”
</p>
<p>4. The next property we declare of God in the Creed is the eternity of God. As He
is the cause of everything in existence, and requires no cause for His existence,
and as it is impossible to separate the idea of existence from the idea of God, it
follows that God is always in existence, and that neither beginning nor end can be
fixed to His existence. Maimonides, in expressing his belief in the eternity of God,
lays stress only on God being without a beginning, and in this sense he interprets
the phrase Dip <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהי קדם‎</span> (Deut. xxxiii. 27), “the eternal God” who is without a beginning. That God is without
end is equally true, but Maimonides did not desire to introduce this idea into the
fourth article as a distinguishing characteristic, as it is not necessary to believe
that the universe will once come to an end. If it please the Almighty to give the
universe existence for ever, it will continue for ever. Following, however, the example
of the prophets, who told us in the name of God, “I am the first, and I am the last,”
we express this idea in our Creed, and understand it thus: If, by the will of the
Almighty, the entire universe should come to an end, God’s existence would still continue.
Thus the Psalmist says, “Of old hast Thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the
heavens are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; yea,
all of them shall wax old like a garment: as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and
they shall be changed: but Thou <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>art the same, and Thy years shall have no end” (Ps. cii. 26–28).
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.4">The fourth article is:—
</p>
<p>“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His name, was the first, and will be
the last.</i>”
</p>
<p>6. After having declared our faith in God as the sole Ruler of the universe, who is
One, incorporeal and eternal, we proclaim Him as our Supreme Master, who alone is
capable of granting our petitions. All existing things are under His control; all
forces in nature only work at His will and by His command. No other being possesses
the power and independence to fulfil our wishes of its own accord, if it were approached
by us with our prayers. It is, therefore, to Him alone that we can reasonably address
our petitions, and in doing so we have confidence in the efficacy of our prayers,
for “the Lord is nigh to all those who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in
truth” (Ps. cxlv. 18).
</p>
<p>This article, although expressly directed against idolatry, and primarily against
the worship of “the angels, the stars, and the spheres,” implies our belief in God
as the Omnipotent, who can do everything, and can help us when we have not any prospect
of relief.
</p>
<p>We therefore declare in the fifth article:—
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.5">“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His name, alone is worthy of being worshipped,
and that no other being is worthy of our worship.</i>”
</p>
<p>The Omnipotence of God is also implied in the first article, which declares Him the
Creator and the Ruler of the universe. That Maimonides does not directly <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>make omnipotence, like unity, incorporeality, &amp;c., the subject of a separate article
has its good reason, and is not “the result of mere chance.” Silly questions were
frequently asked; <i>e.g.</i>, how far the omnipotence of God extended, whether it implied the power of making
twice two equal to three, or the whole of a magnitude larger than the sum of its parts,
and similar logical impossibilities. To avoid misunderstanding, Maimonides did not
express our belief in the omnipotence of God in a separate article, but the first
and the fifth articles imply it.
</p>
<p id="ch1.1.5.1">We believe of God that He is <i>immutable</i> or <i>unchangeable</i>. It is, however, not necessary to express this in a separate article. By declaring
the Unity of God we proclaim also His Immutability, since unity, in the sense in which
we conceive it, is incompatible with any kind of change. Whatever the change might
be that we assumed in God, it would destroy the idea of His unity.
</p>
<p>There are other qualities which we ascribe to God. We call Him perfect, all-wise,
good, kind, merciful, long-suffering, and the like; in short, whatever we find in
our own person good and noble we believe to be present in God in a higher degree,
in the most perfect form. But these attributes approach very closely anthropomorphisms,
which Maimonides rigidly excludes from the Creed. They express rather the impressions
produced in our soul by the different acts of God’s Providence, and do not describe
God Himself.
</p>
<p>Of this class of attributes are the thirteen divine attributes, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש עשרה מדות‎</span> (Exod. xxxiv. 6). They <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>describe in thirteen terms the goodness and mercy of God towards man in his various
conditions of innocence, guilt, and repentance. These are not distinctly mentioned
in our Creed, but when we declare that He is the only Being whom we can address in
our prayers, we are certainly conscious and convinced that He, being good, kind, and
merciful, listens to our supplications.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>Revelation</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה מן השמים‎</span>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch1.2.1" class="first">The second group of principles refers to Revelation. The real process of revelation,
by what means and in what manner the infinite and incorporeal Being makes His Will
known to man, and how the latter becomes conscious and convinced of the fact that
a Divine communication has been made to him, remains a mystery to all but those privileged
persons who have been actually addressed by the Almighty. “As the blind man who had
never possessed the sense of sight is incapable of comprehending the actual process
of seeing, so are we, born without that wonderful prophetic eye, without the prophetic
faculty of the mind, incapable of comprehending and depicting the process of inspiration
that goes on within the mind of the privileged” (Schmiedl, <i lang="de">Studien</i>, p. 183). God reveals Himself also in nature, in the power and wisdom displayed in
its phenomena. He reveals Himself in the history of nations, and especially in the
history of Israel. He reveals Himself in the intelligence of man. In all these cases
the revelation is made to all alike. Those who have eyes may see, those who have ears
may hear, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>recognise, every one according to his capacity, the presence of the Almighty in the
working of the laws of nature, in the development and fates of nations, and in the
life of every individual person. In all these cases we can test and prove the revelation
by ourselves, and need not exclusively rely on authority. When, however, a Divine
communication is made to one privileged individual, through whom it is made known
to a whole community, or to mankind, there is no other means of testing the correctness
of the revelation than the trustworthiness of the privileged individual.
</p>
<p>The first lesson or proof given to the Israelites of the fact that such revelation
was not only possible, but had actually been vouchsafed by the Almighty, was the revelation
on Mount Sinai, the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעמד הר סיני‎</span>, which became the foundation of the faith of Israel. “And the Lord said unto Moses,
Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with
thee, and may also believe thee for ever” (Exod. xix. 9). The trustworthiness of Moses
having thus been tested and established “for ever,” his teaching remained the foundation
of the teaching of all succeeding prophets, and the test of their truthfulness and
genuineness. A prophet who taught anything opposed to the law of Moses could not be
a true prophet, although he supported his words by signs and miracles (Deut. xiii.
2, <i>sqq.</i>). Besides, revelation of the Divine Being had taken place before. God revealed Himself
to the first man. Adam heard the voice of God; he felt the presence of the Almighty,
and learnt the amount of evil man brings upon himself by disobeying the word of God.
The <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>consciousness of the existence of God, and of the fact that He has revealed Himself
to man, has been inherited by the descendants of Adam. It has not been preserved in
all men in the same strength and purity. The notion of a Divine Being, and of His
revelation to man, became in course of time corrupt, and led to the corruption of
the human race, with the exception of Noah and his family. “Noah was a righteous man;
perfect he was in his generations: with God did Noah walk” (Gen. vi. 9). The inherited
consciousness of God’s existence and of His rule over man was strengthened in him
by fresh, direct revolution of God. He was told that the wicked would be destroyed
by a flood, and that he with his family would be saved. “The righteous man” witnessed
the infliction which the wicked brought upon themselves by evil deeds, and also that
protection of himself and his family which had been promised and granted by the Almighty.
After Noah had left the ark the word of God was again communicated to him, promising
that never again would a flood be sent to destroy all living beings—a promise which
succeeding generations up to the present have seen fulfilled. In the midst of rain
the “sign of covenant,” the rainbow, reminds us still of His promise and its fulfilment.
Of the descendants of Noah the Semites alone seem to have preserved the belief in
God’s existence and His revelation to man in its original purity; and of the Semites
it was Abraham who was chosen by Providence to be the founder of a family of faithful
believers in God, who formed, as it were, the centre from which the true faith should
spread in all directions over the whole face of the earth. Abraham <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>received Divine communications, and so also his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob.
Even when the children of Israel were in Egyptian slavery, and when they did not hearken
to Moses “because of anguish of spirit, and because of cruel bondage,” the memory
of these revelations was never entirely extinguished in their minds; and when again
addressed by Moses and Aaron “the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord
had visited the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, then they
bowed their heads and worshipped” (Exod. iv. 31). Their faith was strengthened when
they witnessed the fulfilment of the Divine message which was brought to them by Moses:
“And they believed in the Lord, and in Moses His servant” (<i>Ibid.</i> xiv. 31).
</p>
<p>The foundation of the belief in the possibility of Divine revelation having thus been
laid, that belief was further strengthened through the revelation on Mount Sinai,
when every Israelite heard and understood the words addressed to him by God, “who
had brought them out of Egypt, of the house of bondage;” they heard the very words
which Moses subsequently told them in the name of God, and they were convinced of
the truth of the words of Moses. He taught them that there would be other persons
chosen by God to bring messages from Him to the children of Israel or to mankind,
and at the same time he laid down the rule by which the truth of such messages could
be tested.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.2">A person favoured by Divine communications was called a prophet, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span>. That which characterised a prophet and distinguished him from the ordinary man <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>was the privilege of being chosen by Providence to be <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאך יי‎</span> “the messenger of God” to man. This notion of the characteristics of a prophet explains
the circumstance that, although Daniel was favoured with numerous prophetic visions,
the book called after his name was not placed among the Prophets, but among the Hagiographa.
It is on account of his addressing his brethren and informing them of the Will of
God that a person was called a prophet.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3190src" href="#xd32e3190">2</a> By simply receiving a communication, without the direction to impart the knowledge
acquired to others, a person may become a man of God, a man in whom there is the spirit
of God, but not a prophet.
</p>
<p>It is our belief that God would not reveal Himself to any one that is unworthy of
such distinction. As a <i lang="la">conditio sine quâ non</i> it was necessary that the prophets distinguished themselves in every kind of virtue,
that they set to their fellow-men an example of purity in thought, loftiness in speech,
and nobility in action. As regards general knowledge and experience they were inferior
to none of their contemporaries. In the Talmud the saying occurs: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין השכינה שורה על אדם אלא אם כן היה חכם גבור ועשיר‎</span> “The Divine spirit does not rest on man, unless he is wise, strong, and rich” (Babyl.
Talm. Shabbath, 92<i>a</i>). This is certainly a true conception of the character of a prophet, “strong” and
“rich” being understood in a figurative sense: “strong” in possessing mastery over
his passions, and “rich” in being contented with what he has (Aboth iv. 1). It was
a matter of indifference, however, whether the <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>prophet was strong in body or weak, whether he had many earthly possessions or none
at all.
</p>
<p>In spite of his distinction from his fellow-men in wisdom, moral strength, and contentedness,
the prophet remained a human being; he was, like every other person, exposed to the
temptation to sin and liable to error. The sins and errors of prophets are recorded
in order to save us from despair when we are conscious of our sinfulness, and to show
us the way to repentance. This is illustrated especially in the history of the prophet
Jonah. The records of the sins of prophets serve as a warning that we should not consider
any man as perfect or deify him.
</p>
<p>Although the prophet is assumed to have been wise, surpassing his fellow-men in knowledge
and wisdom, it is by no means necessary to believe that he was familiar with all sciences,
or that he knew any of the discoveries made in later times. The prophet had frequently
to inform his brethren of what would happen in future, to tell them of things which
no human eye could foresee. But he had in general no greater knowledge of coming events
than other men, except in reference to those events concerning which he had received
a message from God for His people or for mankind.
</p>
<p>Can a man be trained for the office of a prophet? Was there a school or institution
for this purpose? Every one could certainly be trained in the primary conditions of
a prophet, in the exercise of all human virtues, and in the acquisition of all available
knowledge; and it was the duty and the aim of the prophets to encourage all their
brethren to such training by their own example. But the principal element in prophecy
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>the Divine communication, depended solely on the Will of God. “The sons of the prophets”
are generally believed to be the pupils of the prophets; they formed “the schools
of the prophets.” These schools, however, could not have been schools or colleges
in the ordinary sense of the word. The sons of the prophets were instructed by the
prophets, but not with the purpose of training them as prophets. It seems that the
sons of the prophets served as agents for promulgating the inspired messages of their
chief. Most probably they led a simple, pious life, were God-fearing, and spent their
time when meeting together in music and song, repeating hymns and lessons taught by
their master.
</p>
<p>An account of some of the messages and deeds of the prophets is given in the Biblical
books; some of their speeches also are preserved, in the section of the Bible called
“Latter Prophets,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביאים אחרונים‎</span>. The speeches of the prophets were in some cases prepared and written down before
they were spoken, in others delivered <i lang="la">ex tempore</i> without preparation, and were written down afterwards from memory, either by the
prophet himself or by one of his hearers, or were handed down <i lang="la">vivâ voce</i> from generation to generation before they were committed to writing.
</p>
<p>There is another kind of Divine revelation which did not find expression in any message
to the Israelites or to mankind, but in a certain supernatural impulse given to the
thought or will of a person as regards his words and actions. Such an impulse is called
inspiration, and the inspired person is moved to speak or act by the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח יי‎</span> “spirit of the Lord.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was the spirit of the Lord that moved Samson to heroic deeds against the enemies
of his people; David likewise felt that Divine impulse when pouring forth his heart
before the Lord in his Psalms. He says: “The spirit of the Lord spake in me, and His
word was on my tongue” (2 Sam. xxiii. 2). It was the spirit of the Lord that filled
the hearts of those who collected and sifted the Holy Writings containing law, history,
prophecies, and poetry, and gave them the form in which we possess them now.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.3">We are not quite certain as to the form of the letters in the original copies of the
Holy Writings; but from the way in which the Pentateuch is written now in the Synagogue
scrolls, we may infer with certainty that the ancient copies of the Torah contained
no vowels or accents, and that these have come down to us by oral tradition.
</p>
<p>For the multiplication of copies, human copyists had to be employed. It is by no means
contrary to our faith in the Bible to assume that, as far as the human work of these
copyists is concerned, it must have been subject to the fate of all human work, to
error and imperfection. And, in fact, there are many copies of the Bible that abound
in mistakes; there are passages in Scripture that vary in the different manuscripts;
hence the numerous <i lang="la">variæ lectiones</i> met with in the critical editions of the Bible. But, on the other hand, it would
not be reasonable to assume that the holy literature and the national treasure, very
limited in size, should have been neglected by the religious authorities of the time
to such an extent that no reliable, correct copy was kept, to be consulted in case
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>of doubt or difference of opinion. This being the case with all Biblical books, it
applies with special force to the Torah or Pentateuch, which contains the Divine commandments.
The least alteration made by copyists—unknowingly or knowingly—might involve a question
of life and death. Must it not have been the duty of the judicial authority to keep
a correct authorised copy in a safe place? It is certainly most reasonable to assume
that such a copy was kept, and that there were in every generation among the priests
or prophets men who had a thorough knowledge of the Law, and could easily detect any
interference with the text. As the laws do not form a separate section of the Bible,
but are interwoven with a historical account of important events from the Creation
to the death of Moses, the entire Pentateuch, composed of both laws and history, was
preserved with the same anxiety and watchfulness. That great care was taken in copying
the Law we learn from the fact mentioned in the Talmud, that Ezra minutely examined
the three scrolls he found in the Temple, and in three passages noticed different
readings, of which he adopted the one found in two copies.
</p>
<p>The other books of the Bible are of less importance, but the exclusion of error on
the part of the copyist, though it has not the same, has yet a high degree of certainty,
inasmuch as they too formed part of the holy, national literature. If a mistake should
be clearly proved, it would not be contrary to our religious principles to admit it.
But we shall find, after thorough study and examination of the impugned passages,
that there is in each case far greater doubt as to the correctness of any of the numerous
emendations suggested <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>than of the traditional and Massoretic text before us. It may frequently occur that
some emendations appear strikingly correct, and yet after due reflection they are
found more doubtful than the original. It is therefore our duty thoroughly to examine
each proposed emendation, and to hesitate long before admitting the incorrectness
of the received text and the correctness of the emendation.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.4">One of the means of preserving the text of the Scriptures in its integrity has been
the Massorah. The notes which are found in the margin of Biblical books form part
of the Massorah. At first the Massorah was part of the oral tradition; exceptional
forms of letters, punctuation, and words were probably taught <i lang="la">vivâ voce</i>, and learnt by heart, especially by scribes, readers, and teachers. Where a confounding
with other and similar forms was apprehended, attention was called to the fact, and
by certain notes and rules it was guarded against. The material for the Massorah increased
in the course of time, in the same degree as, with the multiplication of copies of
the Scriptures, the number of misreadings and misinterpretations increased. Although
these notes were arranged and written down at a late period, they helped to preserve
the Biblical text in its integrity, and it is therefore stated in the Mishnah (Aboth
iii. 13): “Massorah (tradition) is a fence to the Law.”
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.5">As to the name of the author of each book or section, and the time and place of its
composition, we are guided by the headings where such are extant; in the absence of
these we are left to the resources of our own judgment or fancy. There is no reason
whatever <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>to doubt the correctness of these headings, as the religious and learned authorities
of the time were trustworthy men, who would not add a heading where none was handed
down to them by tradition. Several books and many psalms are therefore left without
a heading; there was no sure tradition about them. How far the heading of a book or
section extends, whether it was meant only for the beginning or for the whole of it,
is in some cases doubtful, and must be decided by the nature and contents of the book.
For instance, the second part of Isaiah, from chap. xl. to the end, has no heading
of its own; it is therefore open to discussion whether the heading in the first verse
of the first chapter describes only the first thirty-nine or all the sixty-six chapters
of the book. It is possible that Psalms, ascribed, according to their heading, to
David, consist of two or more parts, of which one only was composed by David. The
names of the books do not necessarily imply a reference to the author. The Book of
Joshua, <i>e.g.</i>, may have received its name from its contents, the history of the Israelites under
Joshua being contained in it. The two books of Samuel could not have been written
by Samuel, not even the whole of the first book, since the death of Samuel is therein
recorded; but they owe their name to the fact that the first book commences with the
history of Samuel.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Torah</i> or Law is divided into five books, and is therefore called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חומש‎</span> or Pentateuch (Fivefold or Five-book). The names of the five books are: (1) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span> Genesis (Creation); (2) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמות‎</span> Exodus (departure, <i>scil.</i>, of the Israelites from Egypt); (3) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויקרא‎</span> Leviticus (on the laws concerning the Levites or priests), also called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורת כהנים‎</span> “law of the priests;” (4) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏במדבר‎</span> Numbers; (5) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברים‎</span> Deuteronomy, a Greek term denoting “second-law” or “repetition of the law,” a translation
of the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משנה תורה‎</span>.
</p>
<p>These names are derived from the beginnings of the books. The Hebrew names are either
the first word <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>of the book, as is the case in the first and the third books (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויקרא‎</span>), or the first characteristic word, as is the case in the other three books (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמות‎</span> the second word, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏במדבר‎</span> the fifth, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברים‎</span> the second). The English or Greek names describe the subject-matter of the first
section of the book. This applies also to the rest of the Biblical writings.
</p>
<p>The contents of the five books are as follows:—
</p>
<p><i>The first book</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span>).—It begins with the important lesson, the basis of all that is taught in the whole
Bible: that God is the Creator of the whole universe. Then follows an account of the
Creation, the history of the first man and the first woman, their transition from
the state of innocence and happiness to the state of sin and toil, their descendants,
the beginnings of industry and civilisation, the deterioration of mankind, the flood,
Noah, and the succeeding generations to Abraham; the history of the patriarchs Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, or Israel; the immigration of Jacob with his family into Egypt;
and with the death of Joseph, the son of Jacob, the book concludes.
</p>
<p>The book contains principally history, but mention is made also of some religious
institutions. Reference is thus made to the institution of marriage (ii. 23–25); Sabbath
(ii. 1–3); the Covenant of Abraham or the commandment of circumcision (xvii. 1–14);
the prohibition of eating flesh cut off from an animal while alive (ix. 4, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבר מן החי‎</span>), of murder (ix. 5–6), and of eating “the sinew that shrank” (xxxii. 33, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גיד הנשה‎</span>).
</p>
<p><i>The second book</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמות‎</span>).—The history of the family of Jacob, the Israelites, is continued: their sojourn
in <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>Egypt, the Exodus, the journey to Mount Sinai, the Revelation, the erection of the
Tabernacle, and the events in the camp of the Israelites during their stay in the
wilderness of Sinai.
</p>
<p>The Divine precepts take a more prominent place in this book. Chief among these are
the institution of the Jewish Calendar, appointing the month of Abib—Nisan—to be the
first month (xii. 2); the Sacrifice of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread
(chap. xii.); the Sabbath (xvi. 22–30); the Decalogue (chap. xx. 1–12); civil legislation
(xxi. to xxiii.); the year of release (xxiii. 10, 11); and the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש רגלים‎</span> or festivals of pilgrimage to the sanctuary of the Lord; viz., Passover, Pentecost,
and Tabernacles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסח‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבועות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סכות‎</span> xxiii. 14–17).
</p>
<p><i>The third book</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויקרא‎</span>) contains the laws revealed during the stay of the Israelites near Mount Sinai. A
few historical incidents are mentioned in illustration of the Law. Leviticus contains
the laws concerning the sacrifices (i. to vii.); the initiation of Aaron and his sons
as priests (viii. to x.); dietary laws (xi.); laws about cleanness and uncleanness
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרה וטומאה‎</span>) in man and woman (xii. to xv.); the Day of Atonement (xvi.); prohibition of blood
(xvii. 10–14); marriage laws (xviii. and xx. 10–22); laws concerning the holiness
of man (xix.); laws concerning the priests (xxi., xxii. 16) and sacrifices (xxii.
17–33); the Festivals of the Lord (xxiii.); the year of release and the year of jubilee,
and land-laws connected with these (xxv.); laws concerning the transfer of property
to the sanctuary and the priests.
</p>
<p><i>The fourth book</i> records the departure of the Israelites <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>from Mount Sinai, their journeyings until they came to the east of the Jordan in the
plains of Moab; the chief incidents during these travels, viz., the consecration of
the altar, and the instalment of the Levites as assistants to the priests in the performance
of the Divine Service; the first appointment of a council of seventy elders; the punishment
of Miriam for slander; the spies; the rebellion of Korah; death of Miriam; Moses and
Aaron’s sin at Meribah, and their punishment; death of Aaron; wars with Sihon and
Og; the blessings of Bileam instead of his intended cursings; the zeal and distinction
of Phineas; war against Midian; the appointment of Joshua as future leader of Israel.
</p>
<p>There is also in the book a list of all the stations where the Israelites had encamped
during their travels through the Arabian desert (chap. xxxiii.), and a minute description
of the boundaries of the land of Canaan (chap. xxxiv.).
</p>
<p>The following are the principal laws mentioned in Numbers: the laws concerning Nazirites;
concerning a woman suspected of faithlessness against her husband; the second Passover
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסח שני‎</span>) for those who could not fulfil their duty on the 14th of Nisan; the law of fringes
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ציצת‎</span>); the law of purification of persons who have become unclean through contact with
the dead body of any person (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרה אדומה‎</span> chap. xix.); the law of inheritance (xxvii.); the sacrifices for the festivals (xxviii.,
xxix.); the laws of vows (xxx.); laws concerning murder and cities of refuge (xxxv.).
</p>
<p><i>The fifth book</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברים‎</span>) contains speeches of Moses which he addressed to the Israelites during the last
year of his life, reminding them of their repeated disobedience <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>to the Divine command, and their want of confidence in Him, and exhorting them to
be faithful to God. He frequently emphasises the truth that blessing and happiness
can only be obtained through obedience, trouble and curses being the certain result
of sin and transgression. Chapter xxviii., called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תוכחה‎</span> “exhortation” or “rebuke” (see also Lev. xxvi.), is especially devoted to this principle.
In the song <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האזינו‎</span> (chap, xxxii.), which all the people were to learn by heart, Moses rebukes his brethren
for their ingratitude to God, and foretells them that, in the remote future, similar
conduct will be visited severely, and that after a period of punishment God will show
mercy to them, and again restore them to a state of happiness and glory. Before his
death he gives a special blessing to each tribe. The book concludes with the death
of Moses, the succession of Joshua, and the praise of Moses as the greatest of all
prophets.
</p>
<p>Many of the commandments are repeated in the course of the exhortations: the Decalogue,
the laws concerning the three agricultural and national festivals (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש רגלים‎</span>), and such other laws as Moses considered necessary to impress on the heart of the
Israelites before he departed from among them. The Israelites being near Jordan, and
about to take possession of the promised land, their attention is called to such laws
as would then come into practice, <i>e.g.</i>, those which refer to the political and judicial arrangements of the country (xvi.
to xviii.); and the solemn declaration of allegiance to the Will of God (xxvii.).
</p>
<p>The Pentateuch is divided into verses (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסוקים‎</span>), paragraphs (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסקות‎</span>), and into sections called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סדרות‎</span> or <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>“weekly portions.” The division into chapters is of comparatively modern origin.

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> <i>The Prophets</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">are divided into two groups: Earlier and Latter Prophets (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביאים ראשונים ונביאים אחרונים‎</span>).
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.7">The <i>Earlier Prophets</i> do not contain prophecies in the usual meaning of the word. They contain the history
of Israel from the accession of Joshua to the leadership of Israel, to the capture
of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. They are, nevertheless, called “Prophets,”
for two reasons:—
</p>
<p>(1.) The history is written in a prophetic spirit, with the view of illustrating the
principle that obedience to the word of God was the cause of Israel’s prosperity and
success, disobedience the cause of trouble and misery.
</p>
<p>(2.) The Earlier Prophets include the history of Deborah, Samuel, Nathan, Ahijah,
Elijah, Elisha, and a few anonymous prophets.
</p>
<p>No collection of their speeches has been made or preserved in the Scriptures, and
they are thus distinguished from the latter prophets, whose prophecies have been collected
and form the contents of the “Latter Prophets.”
</p>
<p>The following books belong to the Earlier Prophets:—
</p>
<p>1. <i>The Book of Joshua</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהושע‎</span>), containing the history of the conquest and division of the land of Canaan by the
Israelites, from their crossing the Jordan to the death of Joshua.
</p>
<p>Among the various <span class="corr" id="xd32e3514" title="Source: ncidents">incidents</span> related in the book <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>the following are noteworthy:—The circumcision of those who had been born during the
wandering of Israel in the wilderness; the celebration of the first Passover in the
Holy Land; the appearance of “the prince of the host of the Lord” (v. 14), just before
the war commenced, in order to remind Joshua that “the place upon which he stood was
holy;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3519src" href="#xd32e3519">3</a> the crossing of the Jordan; the taking of Jericho; the disastrous consequences of
Achan’s sin, as an illustration of the principle that the whole community is made
responsible for the crime of the individual till the crime is discovered and punished;
the battle at Gibeon, famous through Joshua’s exclamation, “Sun, stand thou still
upon Gibeon; and thou moon, in the valley of Ajalon!” (x. 12); and the appointment
of the cities of refuge.
</p>
<p>2. <i>The Book of Judges</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שופטים‎</span>) contains episodes of the history of the Israelites from the death of Joshua to the
days of the high-priest Eli. The name “Judge” is identical with that of chief magistrate,
or simply chief or leader. The judges were persons chosen by God, and inspired with
an extraordinary spirit of courage and bravery, to be the liberators of the country,
or part of the country, from the tyranny of oppressors. The virtues that were required
in order to qualify them for this mission were patriotism and courage. Some of them
may have continued in power after the restoration of peace and order, but on the whole
their mission as judges was fulfilled with the cessation of <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>war. They were not the religious teachers of the nation, nor are they set up as examples
of piety.
</p>
<p>During the period of the judges the tribes of Israel were not united (song of Deborah,
Judges v. 15–17). There was no common government, or if there was one, it must have
possessed little power and influence. The people became degraded; many worshipped
idols and altogether ignored the Divine commandments. But the conscience of the nation
was roused when a shocking crime was committed at Gibeah in the tribe of Benjamin,
and all Israel united in demanding the punishment of the evil-doers (chaps. xix. to
xxi.). The book contains two beautiful poetical passages, the song of Deborah (v.)
and the parable of Jotham (ix.).
</p>
<p>3. <i>The two books of Samuel</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמואל א׳ וב׳‎</span>)—also called the first and second books of Kings—contain the history of Israel during
the time of the high-priest Eli, the prophet Samuel, and Saul, the first king of Israel
(Book I.); and the reign of David (Book II.).
</p>
<p>The following passages are noteworthy:—
</p>
<p>ii. 6–7: “The Lord killeth and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth
up. The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich; He bringeth low and lifteth up.”
</p>
<p>xii. 22: “The Lord will not forsake His people, for His great name’s sake; because
it hath pleased the Lord to make you His people.”
</p>
<p>xv. 22–23: “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in
obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
than the fat of rams. For rebellion is <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry; because thou
hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee from being king.”
</p>
<p>xvi. 7: “The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,
but the Lord looketh on the heart.”
</p>
<p>xxiv. 14: “Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked.”
</p>
<p>II., xxiv. 14: “I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the Lord;
for His mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.”
</p>
<p>The following poetical passages of the book should also be marked:—
</p>
<p>The prayer of Hannah (ii. 1–10); David’s lament over Saul’s death (II., i. 18–27);
Parable of the prophet Nathan (xii. 1–6); Song of thanksgiving by David (xxii.); David’s
faith in God’s justice (xxiii. 1–7).
</p>
<p>4. <i>The first and the second books of Kings</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכים א׳ וב׳‎</span>), also called the third and fourth books of Kings, contain the history of Israel
from the death of David to the Babylonian exile. The first book describes the last
days of King David, the reign of Solomon, the division of the country into two kingdoms,
Judah and Israel, the history of the kingdom of Judah from Rehoboam to Jehoshaphat,
and the history of the kingdom of Israel from Jeroboam to Ahab. The second book continues
the history of the kingdom of Israel from Ahab to the conquest of Samaria by Shalmanessar,
king of Assyria, and that of the kingdom of Judah from Abijam, son of Jehoshaphat,
to the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.
</p>
<p>I., ii. 2: “I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show thyself
a man.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>xviii. 21: “How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God. follow Him;
but if Baal, then follow him.”
</p>
<p>II., xiv. 9: “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that
was in Lebanon and trod down the thistle.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3567src" href="#xd32e3567">4</a>
</p>
<p>Note, besides, prayer of Solomon (I., viii. 12–61) and message of Isaiah to King Hezekiah
(II., xix. 21–31).
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.8">The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביאים אחרונים‎</span> Latter Prophets, contain the following books:—
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.8.1">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I. <i>Isaiah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ישעיהו‎</span>).—Isaiah prophesied chiefly during the Assyrian invasions in Palestine in the reign
of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The book is divided into two
main sections, separated from each other by the narrative of Sennacherib’s invasion
and defeat, Hezekiah’s illness and recovery, and the congratulatory message of the
Babylonian king to Hezekiah (chaps, xxxvi. to xxxix.). The first section is divided
into five parts with separate headings:—
</p>
<p>(1.) Chap. i.—This prophecy was probably repeated by Isaiah many times from the beginning
to the end of his prophetic mission. The Israelites in Jerusalem and Judah are rebuked
for their rebellion against God, which has brought a series of misfortunes upon the
nation; God does not accept their sacrifices unless they return to Him and improve
their conduct. They will be punished, but the punishment is only the means <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>for their purification. When this effect is obtained their redemption will follow.
</p>
<p>(2.) Chaps. ii. to v.—The fulfilment of the mission of the Israelites—the Messianic
period—is depicted, when the Israelites will be so perfect in the knowledge and the
worship of God, that all nations will seek enlightenment and guidance in the house
of the God of Jacob. The prophet shows his brethren how they receded from that aim,
and, estranging themselves from the Almighty, trusted in things that are powerless.
But all these things, grand and high as they may appear, will prove worthless, and
the glory of God will in the end be recognised. The prophet illustrates the conduct
of the Israelites and their punishment in the beautiful parable of the vineyard (v.
1–7). As special sins are named: greediness, lust, mockery, and injustice. The punishment
threatened is the invasion of a cruel conqueror.
</p>
<p>(3.) Chap. vi.—On the occasion of the death of King Uzziah, who had presumed to approach
God and to offer incense in the Holy of Holies, contrary to the Law, and was punished
with leprosy, Isaiah had a vision in which he despairingly contrasted the infinite
holiness of the Almighty with his own sinfulness, living as he did among people of
unclean lips. He is reassured, and shown that his sin is removed when his words are
inflamed by the holy fire taken from the altar of God. He must, nevertheless, not
expect a speedy effect from his words to the people; they will continue in disobedience
and bring upon themselves continued punishments, but ultimately, when the leaves have
fallen off, the stem will remain—<i>a seed of holiness</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>(4.) vii. to xii.—The invasion of Judah by Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin, king
of Aram, brings to light the want of faith in God and His word on the part of Ahaz,
king of Judah. Isaiah, taking with him his son <i>Sh’ar-yashub</i> (“A-remnant-will-return”), a reminder of punishment and of redemption, rebukes Ahaz,
and gives him a sign (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אות‎</span>): “The young woman is with child, and will bear a son, and call his name <i>Immanuel</i>” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עמנו אל‎</span> “God-is-with-us”). <span class="corr" id="xd32e3606" title="Not in source">“</span>Cream and honey shall he eat, when he will know to reject the evil and to choose the
good.” By this sign Ahaz is informed (1) that at the time of the birth of the child
Judah will be freed from the armies of the two kings, and the name Immanuel was to
be the expression of thanks for the delivery; (2) another more serious invasion of
the Assyrians will come and devastate the country; and after their departure the Israelites
will not have any corn or bread; “cream and honey will every one eat that is left
in the midst of the land.”
</p>
<p>The invasion of Syria and Palestine by the Assyrians is also foretold in the very
name of Isaiah’s own son, Maher-shalal-’hash-baz (“The spoiler hastens to be quick
with the spoil”). In spite of such dark prospect the prophet sets forth the testimony
and the lesson (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תעודה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה‎</span>): “Hope in the Lord, though He hides His face from the house of Jacob. For often
have people in affliction seen great light.” “A child<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3616src" href="#xd32e3616">5</a> has been born unto us, called The Almighty, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>Eternal, the Prince of Peace, devises wonders, for the purpose of increasing the dominion
and establishing endless peace upon the throne of David and his kingdom, to order
it and support it by judgment and righteousness from now even for ever” (ix. 5, 6).
The Assyrian invasion is a punishment for the sins of the Israelites, and its success
will continue so long as the Israelites refuse to repent and to return to God. This,
however, will ultimately come to pass, and Ashur will then receive the penalty for
his insolence and presumptuousness. Israel will in the end be guided by a wise and
just ruler, who will spring forth from the roots of Jesse. The Messianic times will
then begin, and amidst universal peace all mankind will join in the praises of God.
</p>
<p>(5.) xiii. to xxxv.—This group of prophecies was probably delivered during the Assyrian
invasion. Isaiah takes a survey of the neighbouring states, their conduct in times
of success, and their well-deserved punishment <span class="corr" id="xd32e3623" title="Corrected by author from: in immediate">in the immediate</span> or the remote future. The prophecies are directed against Babylon, Plesheth, Moab,
Damascus, Egypt, Ashdod, Babylon, Dumah, Arab, the Assyrian Shebnah, Tyre, Edom, and
Ephraim. Great confusion will ensue, amid which Judah will suffer much, but he will
ultimately be delivered through the Divine intervention, and will thus be strengthened
in his faith in God. Isaiah rebukes Judah for seeking help from Egypt against Assyria,
because such an act indicates want of faith in God. It is only the Almighty that can
help in times of distress.
</p>
<p>(6.) xxxvi. to xxxix.—The historical chapters which intervene between the two large
prophetical sections of <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>the book conclude with an account of Hezekiah’s conduct towards the Babylonian ambassadors,
and the rebuke he received of Isaiah, who announced to the king that the Babylonians
would one day be conquerors of Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>(7.) xl. to xlviii.—The prediction of the Babylonian exile is followed by comforting
messages and by the good tidings of the promised Restoration. Contrasting the omnipotence
of God with the helplessness of earthly powers and idols, the prophet calls for absolute
faith in God, who has already appointed the conqueror of Babylon and the liberator
of the exiled Jews.
</p>
<p>(8.) xlviii. to liv.—It is not only deliverance from exile that the Jews have to hope
for, but far greater things. The people of the Lord are to become glorious, and to
be the source of salvation to all mankind. They will suffer at the hand of the nations,
but the latter will ultimately see what wrong they have done to Israel. Notwithstanding
all apparent obstacles, this prophecy will be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>(9.) lv. to lx.—The prophet exhorts the people to follow the word of God, to abandon
idolatry, and to be sincere in their prayer and repentance; only then might they hope
for salvation. God has punished Israel, but the redeemer will come unto Zion.
</p>
<p>(10.) lxi. to lxvi.—Encouragement is given especially to the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוים‎</span> “the meek,” “the broken-hearted;” the day of vengeance is announced against the haughty
and sinners. The prophet prays to God, and God answers him with the promise of the
ultimate triumph of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יראי יי‎</span> “the meek and the God-fearing.”
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.8.2">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">2. <i>Jeremiah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ירמיה‎</span>).—Jeremiah prophesied in the thirteenth <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>year of Josiah, and continued to prophesy during his reign and that of his successors,
and after the fall of Jerusalem, but it is not certain how long he lived after the
destruction of the Temple, and where he died. He was the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
in Anathoth, in the tribe of Benjamin. He was exposed to cruel persecutions, but these
did not deter him from delivering the Divine message with which he was entrusted to
the king and to the people. The prophecies of Jeremiah were written down by Baruch,
at Jeremiah’s dictation (chap. xxxvi.), but the book was seized by King Jehoiakim,
and burnt by him. The Book of Jeremiah, in our Bible, is probably the copy made later
on by Baruch, and mentioned <span class="corr" id="xd32e3655" title="Not in source">in </span>Jer. xxxvi. 32.
</p>
<p>The book is composed of the following parts:—
</p>
<p>(1.) Chap. i.—The appointment of Jeremiah as prophet “over the nations and the kingdoms,
to pluck up and to break down, and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant”
(ver. 10).
</p>
<p>(2.) Chaps, ii. to vi.—Jeremiah addresses the inhabitants of Jerusalem. “Israel is
a holy portion, belonging to the Lord; whosoever eats of it is guilty, and will be
punished.” Israel ought therefore to be faithful to God. This they are not, in spite
of the benefits bestowed on them; they are exhorted to repentance: in vain. They are
therefore threatened with a hostile invasion from the north.
</p>
<p>(3.) Chaps, vii. to x.—The prophet addresses the people in the gate of the Temple,
exhorting them to true repentance. Without obedience to God the Temple and sacrificial
service have no value. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>foundation of the Law is, “<i>You shall be to me a people, and walk in the way which I command you.</i>” You have not obeyed, and punishment is determined upon. Jeremiah, foreseeing the
desolation of the country and the ruin of the nation, laments and weeps, but he is
sure that God is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשה חסד משפט וצדקה‎</span> “one who doth loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness,” and that those nations
which indulged in cruelties against the Israelites when under Divine punishment will
themselves not escape retribution.
</p>
<p>(4.) xi. to xiii.—“The covenant was: Hear my voice, and do what I command you: ye
shall be my people, and I will be your God.” You have broken this covenant and worshipped
idols; evil must come upon you. This Jeremiah proclaimed in “the cities of Judah and
the streets of Jerusalem,” and probably also in Anathoth; whereupon he was threatened
with death. Such conduct gave occasion to further prophecies concerning the wickedness
of the people and their impending punishment. The fact that Israel has been chosen
to be the people of the Lord and has shown himself unworthy of the distinction, is
symbolised by a girdle, forming at first an ornament to man, but which when rotten
by moisture in the crevices of rocks, is no longer of any use.
</p>
<p>(5.) Chaps, xiv. to xvii.—Drought visits Judah; Jeremiah prays to God for relief from
famine. God rejects his petition. The prophet is disappointed, but he is assured that
God will protect him from the attacks of the people, if he tries “to bring forth a
precious thing from the vile.” He tries, but in vain.
</p>
<p>(6.) xvii. 19–27.—Exhortation to keep the Sabbath, <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>to abstain from all manner of work, and from carrying burdens out of or into the town.
</p>
<p>(7.) xviii.—God changes His decrees according to the deeds of man, as a potter transforms
the clay from one vessel to another. Jeremiah is again insulted and threatened, and
he prays to God against his persecutors.
</p>
<p>(8.) xix. and xx.—In the valley of Hinnom, Jeremiah denounces the idolatry of Israel,
and as a symbol of the impending ruin of Israel, he breaks a pot of earthenware. Returning
from the valley, he announces the coming evil in the court of the Temple in the presence
of the people; he is taken into prison by Pashchur, the chief of the Temple, for one
day. When released he repeats the same prophecy, but feels that he has given offence,
and in utter despair curses the day of his birth.
</p>
<p>(9.) Chaps, xxi. to xxiv.—Nebuchadnezzar attacked Judah, and Zedekiah (later king
of Judah) sent to Jeremiah asking him to pray for the safety of the people. But Jeremiah
prophesied defeat and disgrace on account of their iniquity. He went even by the command
of God to the royal palace, and repeated there the Divine decree against the royal
family, Shallum (= Joahaz), Jojakim, and Coniah (= Jeboiachin). There will come, however,
one day a righteous offspring of David, who will rule justly and prosperously; He
shall be called “The Lord is our salvation.” For the present it would be better to
submit to the Babylonian rule. They are false prophets who flatter and speak in the
name of God of victories over the Babylonians. The false prophets will all be punished—<span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>those who proclaim as their own prophecy the very words they heard from true prophets,
those who in different words reproduce messages of the true prophets as their own,
and those who invent falsehood. The advisability of submitting to the Babylonian power
is also illustrated by the vision of two baskets of figs; good figs representing those
who will submit, and bad figs those who prefer war with the Babylonians.
</p>
<p>(10.) xxv. to xxvii.—Jeremiah continues, during the reign of Jehoiakim, his prophecies
in favour of a peaceful submission to the Babylonians, with the Divine promise of
a redemption from the exile and the restoration to their own country and dominion.
</p>
<p>(11.) xxviii.—The same prophecy is continued during the reign of Zedekiah. He was
opposed by the false prophet Hananiah, to whom Jeremiah foretold that he would be
punished and die the same year; this came also to pass.
</p>
<p>(12.) xxix. to xxxi.—To the Jews already in Babylon Jeremiah sends a letter of consolation
and encourages them in their hopes for the redemption from exile. Of the same tenor
were the messages spoken by Jeremiah to all Jews. In days to come a new covenant will
be instituted; new in so far as it will not be broken again, the Law remaining permanently
written on their heart, “<i>I shall be their God, and they shall be my nation.</i>”
</p>
<p>(13.) xxxii. and xxxiii.—Jeremiah, kept in prison, bought property from his uncle
Hanamel, wrote and signed the document of transfer, and handed it to Baruch. By this
he expressed his conviction that the Jews would return from exile and take possession
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>their land. In addition to this he sent forth from the prison a Messianic prophecy,
describing the future greatness of the seed of David, and the restoration of the priests
and Levites to the sacrificial service.
</p>
<p>(14.) xxxiv. and xxxv.—Jeremiah exhorts the people to keep “the year of release,”
and held up the family of the Rechabites as patterns of piety, who could not be induced
to break their vow of abstinence, though it was voluntarily undertaken.
</p>
<p>(15.) xxxvi. to xlv.—Jeremiah continues to prophesy, advising, though fruitlessly,
submission to the Babylonian king. Zedekiah made war against Nebuchadnezzar, was defeated,
and Jerusalem was taken by the Babylonians. When some Jews wanted to emigrate to Egypt,
Jeremiah warned them in the name of God not to do so. He was not listened to; he was
even forced to go with them; but he prophesied against them, and foretold their ruin.
Baruch, to whom Jeremiah dictated his prophecies, was discontented at being driven
from place to place; Jeremiah appeased and encouraged him.
</p>
<p>(16.) xlvi. to lii.—Jeremiah prophesies against Egypt, the Philistines, Moab, Ammon,
Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Elam, and Babylon. The book concludes with an account of the
fall of Jerusalem, similar to that given at the end of the second book of Kings.

<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.8.3">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">3. <i>Ezekiel</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יחזקאל‎</span>)—Ezekiel prophesied in exile.
</p>
<p>(1.) Chap. i. to vii.—In the fifth year of the exile of Joiachin, Ezekiel, in the
vision of the chariot, representing the rule of God over the universe, is appointed
a Divine messenger, to warn the people and tell them of the impending danger, that
they might not be <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>ignorant of the fate awaiting them, whether they listened or forbore to listen. The
message with which he is inspired is represented as a scroll which he swallows. The
threatened danger he indicates by symbolic acts, followed by their explanation. The
siege of Jerusalem is illustrated by the prophet besieging a brick representing Jerusalem,
and the ruin of the nation by cutting and scattering the hair of his head and beard.
</p>
<p>(2.) viii. to xi.—In the sixth year, on the sixth day of the fifth month, in the presence
of the elders of Judah, Ezekiel is carried in a prophetic vision to Jerusalem, is
shown there the sins committed by the Israelites in the very Temple, and the consequent
departure of the Divine Presence from the Temple. Israel will suffer for his sins,
but will at last repent and improve. God promises, “<i>I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take
the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; that they
may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them; and they shall be
my people, and I will be their God</i>” (xi. 19, 20).
</p>
<p>(3.) xii. and xiii.—The prophet indicates the coming captivity by the symbolic act
of preparing the things necessary for going into exile. The false prophets and prophetesses,
who tell the people to have no dread of any coming exile, will be disappointed and
punished. The falsehood of the proverb, “In the length of time every vision faileth,”
will then be evident.
</p>
<p>(4.) xiv. to xix.—Ezekiel describes the sinfulness of Israel, and exhorts them to
return to God, or else the threatened calamity will overcome them. He illustrates
the approaching calamity by the figure of a <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>cedar-tree and the eagle. Although the fathers have sinned, if the sons abstain from
sinning they may prevent the catastrophe; for the proverb, “The fathers have eaten
the sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge,” will prove untrue.
If they do not improve, the catastrophe must take place which the prophet depicts
in the parables of the lioness caught and of the vine consumed by fire.
</p>
<p>(5.) xx.—In the seventh year, the Elders of Israel came to Ezekiel “to inquire of
the Lord,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לדרש את ה‎</span>. Ezekiel describes the wickedness of Israel, and the punishment they deserved.
</p>
<p>(6.) xxi. to xxiii.—Comparing Jerusalem and Samaria to two sisters, Oholibah and Oholah,
he complains that the former, having witnessed the punishment of the latter, has not
profited by it.
</p>
<p>(7.) xxiv.—On the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year Ezekiel prophesies
the siege and fall of Jerusalem on the very day on which the siege commenced. The
greatness of the calamity, to express which the usual outward signs of grief would
be inadequate, is indicated by the Divine command that the prophet on the death of
his wife should exhibit no signs of mourning.
</p>
<p>(8.) xxv. to xxxii.—Like Isaiah and Jeremiah, he foretells the fate of the neighbouring
nations, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines, Tyrians, and Egyptians. The last-named
are promised recovery after forty years’ desolation of their country.
</p>
<p>(9.) xxxiii. and xxxiv.—The prophet describes the duties and responsibilities of watchmen
and shepherds, and blames those of his own time as not fulfilling <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>their duties: “But I will save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will
judge between cattle and cattle. <i>And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant
David: he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be
their God, and my servant David prince among them</i>” (xxxiv. 22–24).
</p>
<p>(10.) xxxv.—He prophesies against Seir, for their enmity against Israel.
</p>
<p>(11.) xxxvi. and xxxvii.—Ezekiel foretells the restoration of Israel in the parable
of the dry bones. The union of Israel and Judah is symbolically shown by the union
of two staves.
</p>
<p>(12.) xxxviii. and xxxix.—Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, will make the
last efforts for the destruction of Israel. All his preparations will be in vain.
He and his army will fall in the land of Israel. And the Divine promise is given:
“<i>They shall know that I am the Lord their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity
among the nations, and have gathered them into their own land, and I will leave none
of them any more there: neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have
poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God</i>” (xxxix. 28, 29).
</p>
<p>(13.) xl. to xlviii.—In the fourteenth year after the fall of Jerusalem, in the beginning
of the year, on the tenth day of the month, Ezekiel is carried in a vision to the
land of Israel, and is shown there the rebuilding of the future Temple, and the division
of the land among the twelve tribes, the Levites and the priests.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 last-child section" id="ch1.2.8.4">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">4. <i>The Twelve Minor Prophets</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תרי עשר‎</span>—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>(1.) <i>Hosea</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הושע‎</span>).—Hosea, a contemporary of Isaiah, prophesied about the sinfulness of the northern
kingdom of the ten tribes, and turns his attention to Judah only in so far as Judah
participated in the sins of Israel, and their consequences.
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) Chaps, i. to iii.—In an allegory of a faithless woman and her three children the
sin of the ten tribes is represented, who faithlessly turned away from the worship
of God in Jerusalem. The consequent three stages of punishment are represented by
the names of the three children: Jezreel, referring to the catastrophe of the house
of Ahab, ending in the death of Jezebel in Jezreel; Lo-ruhama (“Not pitied”), indicating
the fall of the house of Jehu, from which the mercy of God was withdrawn after it
had been shown in the successes of King Jeroboam II.; and the third, Lo-ami (“Not-my-people”),
predicting the final dissolution of the kingdom. But a time of mercy and Divine protection
is foretold by the prophet when he said in the name of God, “I will betroth thee unto
me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and judgment and in
loving-kindness and in mercy; and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and
thou shalt know the Lord; and I will sow them unto me in the land, and I will show
mercy to Lo-ruhama; and I will say to Lo-ami, Thou art my people; and he shall say,
My God” (ii. 21, 22, 25). This happy time, however, will only come after a period
of trial, represented in the allegory by the period of trial of a faithless woman
before the husband has again full confidence in her. “For many days shall the children
of Israel dwell without king, without prince, without sacrifice, <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>without a statue, and without ephod and teraphim. After that the children of Israel
will return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and they will anxiously
hasten to the Lord and to His goodness in latter days” (iii. 4, 5).
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) iv. to viii.—Hosea rebukes Ephraim for their sinfulness and obstinacy. When an attempt
is made at repentance it is not made in earnest, and is soon abandoned. The sins of
Ephraim find imitation in Judah, and therefore the punishment of Ephraim will also
affect Judah.
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) ix. to xiv.—The prophet blames Israel for seeking help in their distress in Egypt
or Assyria. He censures their conduct, and contrasts it with the kindness of God in
the course of the history of Israel since the time of the patriarchs. Samaria must
fall, but Israel need but earnestly return to God, and “he will be like dew to Israel,
who will blossom like the lily, and extend his roots like the cedars of Lebanon” (xiv.
6); for “<i>straight are the ways of the Lord: whilst the righteous walk by them, transgressors
stumble by them</i>” (<i>Ibid.</i> 10).
</p>
<p>(2.) <i>Joel</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יואל‎</span>).—Joel is a contemporary of Isaiah. Locusts have devastated the fields in Judah.
Joel exhorts the people to repentance and prayer. His exhortation is acted upon, and
relief is promised. At the same time the punishment of the enemies of Israel in the
valley of Jehoshaphat is announced. “The day of the Lord, great and wonderful,” will
be indicated by extraordinary phenomena in heaven and on earth, so clear that all
will understand their significance and foresee the coming judgment.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>(3.) <i>Amos</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עמוס‎</span>)—Amos, a contemporary of the former, prophesied during the reign of Uzziah, king
of Judah, and Jeroboam, king of Israel. Amos first mentions in short paragraphs the
sinful conduct of the neighbouring states, Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab,
and Judah, and the punishment decreed against them, introducing each paragraph with
the words, “For three sins of … (<i>scil.</i>, will I take back the decree of punishment), but for the fourth, I will not take
it back.” He then dwells on the sins of Israel, laying special stress on the luxuries
of the rich, obtained through oppression of the poor, and tells them that, though
God has frequently pardoned, He will pardon no more. Amaziah, a priest of Beth-el,
warns Amos, and bids him leave the country, but the prophet, nevertheless, continues
to proclaim the coming judgment of God, viz., the exile of Israel, adding, however,
the comforting prophecy that the time will come when Israel shall be restored to his
own land and enjoy lasting happiness.
</p>
<p>(4.) <i>Obadiah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבדיה‎</span>).—Obadiah prophesies against the Edomites, and announces the Divine decree against
them for their cruel treatment of Judah in times of distress.
</p>
<p>(5.) <i>Jonah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יונה‎</span>).—Jonah, son of Amittai, prophesied success to King Jeroboam II. (2 Kings xiv. 25).
He was sent to threaten the inhabitants of Nineveh with the destruction of their city
in forty days. Instead of going to Nineveh he set out in a boat for Tarshish; during
a storm he was thrown overboard, swallowed by a fish, and again brought to the shore.
He then carried out the Divine mission, the result of which was that the Ninevites
repented of their evil deeds and <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>obtained a respite. Jonah, disappointed that the threat of which he was the bearer
was not fulfilled, was rebuked by God, and taught by his own grief at the destruction
of a plant “that had come up in a night” how wrong it was to wish that God should
not show mercy upon the inhabitants of Nineveh, and to neglect anything that could
lead to their repentance and consequent salvation.
</p>
<p>(6.) <i>Micah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מיכה‎</span>).—Micah of Moresha was likewise a contemporary of Isaiah. He prophesied in Judah.
</p>
<p>1. (i.–iii.) He raises his voice especially against the princes, magistrates, and
false prophets, who unite in oppressing and ruining the people. When Micah tells them
their sins and the coming punishment, they say to him, “Do not preach; they do not
preach for such things; they do not offend” (ii. 6). But the prophet of the Lord is
not deterred from his mission, but continues to denounce their wickedness: “Her chiefs
judge for bribery, and her priests teach for payment, and her prophets decide for
silver; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord in our midst? no
evil shall come upon us. Therefore shall Zion be plowed into a field, and Jerusalem
shall become heaps, and the mountain of the Temple as the high places of a forest”
(iii. 11, 12).
</p>
<p>2. (iv.–v.) Like Isaiah, he depicts the Messianic period, in which the house of Jacob
will be an example of true faith in God to all nations; in which Israel will be restored
to his land, under the rule of a descendant of David. But a period of trials and troubles
must precede those happy days, in order to punish Israel, and to purify and prepare
him for his future greatness.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. (vi.–vii.) The same principles are taught in the next part (vi. and vii.) in the
form of a controversy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ריב ליי עם עמו‎</span>) between the Lord and His people. The latter are reminded of the benefits God has
bestowed on them; and when they ask how they are expected to show their gratitude,
the prophet says, “<i>O man, He has told thee what is good; and what does the Lord require of thee but to
do justice, love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?</i>” (vi. 8).
</p>
<p>(7.) <i>Nahum</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נחום‎</span>).—The fall of Nineveh is predicted. The power of the mighty Assyrian Empire, hitherto
a terror to Judah and other kingdoms, will come to an end; no remedy can save her
any more.
</p>
<p>(8.) <i>Habakkuk</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חבקוק‎</span>).—Habakkuk prophesied at the time when the Casdim or Chaldeans were about to occupy
the place of the Assyrians as conquerors of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and to become
the rod in the hand of God for the punishment of Israel. Habakkuk, on receiving the
mission to announce the Casdim as the executors of the Divine decree, is at a loss
to understand why these wicked and cruel people should be chosen to chastise those
who are far less wicked; why the evil-doer should swallow him who is more righteous.
The answer he receives is, “But the just shall live by his faith.” The evil-doer will
in due time receive his full punishment. Habakkuk then gives expression to his implicit
faith in the justice of God, in a hymn which is superscribed, “Prayer (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה‎</span>) of the prophet Habakkuk on account of errors;” for in it he rectifies, as it were,
his previous <span class="corr" id="xd32e3841" title="Corrected by author from: erroneous opinion">groundless doubt</span>.
</p>
<p>(9.) <i>Zephaniah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צפניה‎</span>).—He prophesied in the days <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>of King Josiah. He proclaims the approach of the great day of the Lord, on which all
those who turned away from Him will receive their punishment, all the rich and powerful
who say the Lord does neither good nor evil. He appeals to the humble in the land
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוי ארץ‎</span>) to seek the Lord in prayer, in order to be saved on “the day of the anger of the
Lord.” For the Philistines, the Phœnicians, Moab, Ammon, and Assyria will be punished,
nor will Jerusalem escape free. “I will then turn,” he says in the name of God, “a
pure language to the nations, that all of them will call by the name of God, and serve
Him with one accord” (iii. 9). “In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy
doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of
the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty
on my holy mountain. And I will leave in thy midst a poor and humble people, and they
shall trust in the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity,
and they shall not speak falsehood, and a tongue of deceit shall not be found in their
mouth” (iii. 9, 11–13).
</p>
<p>(10.) <i>Haggai</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חגי‎</span>)—The Israelites, who by the command of Cyrus had discontinued the rebuilding of the
Temple after the foundation had been laid by his permission, were exhorted by Haggai,
in the second year of the reign of Darius, to resume the work. Guided by Zerubbabel
and Joshua, son of Jehozadak, they obeyed, and the prophet describes to them the blessing
which they will henceforth enjoy.
</p>
<p>(11.) <i>Zechariah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכריה‎</span>):—
</p>
<p>1. (i. to vii.) Zechariah, a contemporary of Haggai, <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>exhorts the Israelites to listen to the words of the prophets, seeing that the words
of former prophets have been fulfilled. The Divine scheme for the restoration of Israel
and the rebuilding of the Temple in spite of all obstacles, is shown to the prophet
in various visions. In one vision Joshua is appointed high-priest, notwithstanding
the aspersions of his adversary (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏השטן‎</span>), and <i>Zerubbabel</i> or <i>Zemach</i>, the political chief of the community. Joshua is exhorted “to walk in the ways of
the Lord, to keep the charge entrusted to him, and to guard the House of God and His
courts;” and Zerubbabel is reminded that success is not obtained “by might and strength,
but by the spirit of the Lord.” “Thus the one—Zemach by name—shall sit on his throne
and be ruler, and the other—Joshua—shall sit on his throne and be priest, and a counsel
of peace shall be between the two” (vi. 13).
</p>
<p>2. Chap. viii.—The prophet is asked whether the day of mourning in the fifth month
is to be continued. The prophetic answer is as follows: The reason for the mourning
was, that your fathers did not listen to the word of God, and were punished for their
disobedience. Now, as the time of punishment is over, it is for you to prevent a recurrence
of these sad experiences. What you have to do is this: <i>Speak the truth one to another; truth and judgment of peace judge in your gates. Let
no one plan in his heart the ruin of his neighbour, and do not love to swear falsely.</i> Let the fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months be to the house of
Judah for rejoicing, joy, and good seasons; love truth and peace (viii. 16, 17, 19).
At the same time the promise is given <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>that the time will come when nations will seek the Lord in Jerusalem, and say to the
Jews, “We will go with you, for God is with you” (viii. 23).
</p>
<p>3. (ix.–xi.) The prophet encourages Zion to rejoice in her future mission; her enemies
round about will be brought to silence, and her king, meek and humble, “poor and riding
on an ass,” “will speak peace to the nations, and his rule will extend from sea to
sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth” (ix. 9, 10). Judah and Ephraim will
unite, and both will enjoy the Divine protection. If this has not yet taken place,
it is the fault of the “bad shepherds,” <i>i.e.</i>, the bad leaders of the people.
</p>
<p>4. (xii.–xiv.) The prophet foretells troubles which will come upon Jerusalem when
the nations will make the last effort to take that city. They will be defeated, and
Judah will be filled on that occasion with “a spirit of grace” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח חן ותחנונים‎</span>), and will pray to God for the safety of his enemy; the very Jews, “whom the enemy
desired to pierce,” will pray for him, and mourn for his death as a father mourneth
for the loss of his only child. Judah will then be free from false prophets and bad
shepherds. God will make Himself known to all: “And the Lord will be a King over the
whole earth; on that day will the Lord be One and His name One” (xiv. 9). All will
come to Jerusalem “to worship the King, the Lord Zebaoth, and to celebrate the feast
of Succoth” (<i>Ibid.</i> 16), expressing thereby their conviction that God alone is able to afford protection
and blessing.
</p>
<p>(12.) <i>Malachi</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכי‎</span>).—Malachi, the last of the prophets, exhorts the priests to true reverence of the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>sanctuary, and to conscientious fulfilment of their duties. The distinction of the
priest was based on the distinction of his conduct: “The law of truth was in his mouth,
and iniquity was not found on his lips; in peace and uprightness he walked with me,
and many turned he back from iniquity. For the lips of the priest shall keep knowledge,
and instruction shall they seek of his mouth, for he is a messenger of the Lord Zebaoth”
(ii. 6, 7). Judah is then rebuked for his faithlessness. Both, the Levites (including
the priests) and Judah, will pass through a process of refining; the wicked will be
removed, whilst for “those who fear the name of God” the sun of salvation will shine.
Those who desire to obtain a place among these latter must “remember the law of Moses,
the servant of God, which God commanded him on Horeb for all Israel; statutes and
judgments” (iii. 22). Before the great day of the Lord, the day of judgment, the Lord
will send “the prophet Elijah, who will cause the hearts of fathers and children to
unite in returning to God.”

</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.1">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. <i>Psalms</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהלים‎</span>).—The Psalms are hymns containing <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>praises of God’s greatness, prayers for His mercy, and meditations on His wisdom,
power, justice, and goodness. However various the Psalms are in form and contents,
they have this in common, that they all are based on the purest and sincerest trust
in God’s justice and goodness. “The mighty and proud, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זדים‎</span> who rely on their own strength and are guided by the dictates of their own will,
cannot succeed for ever; the poor and humble, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוים‎</span> who rely on God’s mercy and are guided by the word of God, will not suffer for ever.”
This is the truth which the Psalmist proclaims in his songs over and over again. Yet
there is a great variety in the contents of the Psalms. Some are simply praises of
God’s greatness, <i>e.g.</i>, viii., xix., xxxii., xcii., xcv. to xcix., ciii., civ., &amp;c. Others are the expression
of gratitude, <i>e.g.</i>, ix., xviii., xxxiv., lxvi., lxviii., &amp;c. Many are prayers in time of trouble; in
most of these the suppliant feels sure that God will accept his prayer, and is confident
that help will come. Such psalms are iii., iv., v., vi., xii., xiii., &amp;c. To this
class belong also all the psalms which refer to the troubles of David during the reign
of Saul, as lii., liv., lvi., lix., lxiii., &amp;c.; some of the Asaph-psalms, lxxiii.,
lxxvii., lxxix., lxxx.; the penitential psalms, in which the sinner prays for mercy,
as xxv., xxxii., xxxviii., li.; and those in which a longing is expressed for the
House of God, <i>e.g.</i>, xxvii., xlii., xliii., lxv., lxxxiv. Some psalms are a protest against those who
rely on human force and human cunning instead of having faith in God, a protest of
the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוים‎</span> against the view and creed of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זדים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גאים‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גוים‎</span> <i>e.g.</i>, ix. and x., xi., xiv., xvi., xvii., &amp;c. Some psalms are of a more <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>didactic character, showing the way of true happiness (Ps. i.), depicting a truly
pious life (xv., xxiv.), or the excellence of the word of God, as xix., cxix.; or
the uselessness of sacrifice without purity of heart (xl., l., li.).
</p>
<p>The poetical form of the Psalms, as of Hebrew poetry in general, is parallelism. The
sentences are formed in such a manner that the psalm can be arranged in lines divisible
into two parts, which are either two elements of a single idea, or a double expression
of the same idea, or a combination of two ideas or things opposed to each other, illustrating
an idea by its antithesis. In some of the Psalms the parallelism is perfect throughout,
in others it is partly abandoned, probably in order not to slavishly subordinate the
idea to the form of its expression. The same is to be noticed as regards other forms
of the Psalms. Some are arranged alphabetically, that is, the successive verses begin
with successive letters of the alphabet; but deviations from the plan are met with
almost in all such psalms. There are psalms which are divided into a certain number
of parts or strophes, each part beginning or ending with the same phrase or verse;
but almost invariably these phrases or verses undergo some modification.
</p>
<p>The style is naturally poetical, and figurative language is employed throughout. God
is a Rock (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צור‎</span>), an habitation (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעון‎</span>), a Shepherd (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רועה‎</span>), who feeds His flock with great care and love; He is an eagle, under whose wings
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אברתו‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כנפיו‎</span>) the weak find protection; He rides in the heavens of the heavens of old (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רכב בשמי שמי קדם‎</span>). Man is compared to “grass that withers,” to a “flower that blossoms in the morning,
and in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>evening it is withered and dried up;” the life of man is but a breath (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הבל‎</span>); a lie (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כזב‎</span>); light in the balance (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏במאזנים לעלות‎</span>); he changes like a garment, like a raiment. The days of a long life are like the
days of the heavens, the sun or the moon (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כימי שמים‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לפני שמש‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עם שמש‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לפני ירח‎</span>). The mighty are mountains with many peaks (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הרים גבנונים‎</span>), they have horns like those of the unicorns, whilst the weak are “a wall bent” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קיר נטוי‎</span>), “a fence thrust down” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גדר הדחויה‎</span>); “they have sunk in deep mire;” “they have come into fire and into water;” “the
waters have come unto the soul.” The meek are “broken in heart,” “crushed in spirit.”
The wicked and unjust are like lions and dogs; they have poison “like the poison of
a serpent, like a deaf adder that stoppeth its ears, that does not listen to the voice
of charmers, to the clever sorcerer.” Their words are smooth like cream and oil, whilst
in the heart there are war, daggers, sharp swords. The threatened one runs like a
hind, escapes like a bird. Those who have no higher aim than material enjoyments are
like “sheep driven to death;” “man in his dignity, without understanding, is like
cattle that perish.” Mishaps come upon man like the waves of the sea. The Divine judgment
visits the wicked like a thunderstorm; it shakes the earth like an earthquake or volcano.
Sinners receive “the cup of confusion” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כוס התרעלה‎</span>) at the hand of God; for “a cup is in the hand of the Lord, and the wine therein
is red; it is full with drink, and He pours out from it, but its dregs all the wicked
of the earth will suck and drink.”
</p>
<p>The sinner is punished by his own deed; “he digs a pit and falls into it;” he feels
like a sick person <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>whose “bones are troubled, and wither;” his purification is toe healing of the soul;
he is purified with hyssop; he becomes whiter than snow (li. 9). When man sins he
feels as if he had become a changed creature, as if he had now been born and conceived
in sin (ver. 7); when he repents and improves, God creates in him a new heart, and
renews a firm spirit within him (ver. 12). The wife of the God-fearing man is compared
to the fruitful vine, his children to young olive-trees (cxxviii.). The righteous
will flourish like a palm-tree, will grow high like a cedar upon Lebanon (xcii. 13).
Whilst the righteous is like a tree planted by the brook of water, the wicked are
like chaff which the wind drives away (i. 3, 4). Israel is likened to a vine brought
from Egypt and planted in Palestine (lxxx. 9). Peacefulness and brotherly love, between
high and low, the mighty and the weak, the rich and the poor, the wise and the simple,
are illustrated by the fine oil that flows down from the head to the beard, the beard
that descends over the garments, and the dew of the high Hermon that comes down to
the lower mountains of Zion (cxxx.).
</p>
<p>There are some instances of play upon words (lvi. 9), and of rhymes (cxlv. 11; xxxiv.
6); the latter are apparently not intentional.
</p>
<p>Although we generally speak of the Psalms of David, only a portion of them was composed
by King David; the headings ascribe also one psalm to Moses, two to King Solomon,
twelve to Asaph, one to Heman, and one to Ethan; and some have no author mentioned
in the heading. Many have no superscription at all, and most of these seem to belong
to a later period.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>The individual psalms have various names. The most general of them is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזמור‎</span> a <span class="corr" id="xd32e4091" title="Source: poëm">poem</span>, set in music. Of some it is distinctly stated that they were intended to be sung;
this is expressed in the heading by the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיר‎</span> “song,” which either precedes or follows the title <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזמור‎</span> or stands alone without <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזמור‎</span>. The term, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיר‎</span> “song,” is further qualified by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חנוכת הבית‎</span> “of the dedication of the house,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ידידות‎</span> “of love,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המעלות‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למעלות‎</span> “of degrees leading upward,” <i>i.e.</i>, towards God. Another name occurring in twelve psalms is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משכיל‎</span> “instructive song;” the <i>maschil</i> proclaims the lesson that God is King of the universe, and that those are happy who
trust in His justice and mercy. A similar meaning attaches to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ללמד‎</span> the word superadded to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משכִל‎</span> in Ps. lx.; lit. “to teach,” <i>i.e.</i>, that the song be learnt by all, in order that people may strengthen their confidence
in God in times of trouble (comp. 2 Sam. i. 18). The meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏להזכיר‎</span> which occurs in two psalms (xxxviii. and lxx.), is “for prayer.” There is one psalm
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לתודה‎</span> (c.), “for thanksgiving;” another “for the Sabbath-day,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ליום השבת‎</span> (xcii.). Four psalms are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה‎</span> “prayer” (xvii., lxxxvi., xc, cii.); one (cxlv.), <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהלה‎</span> “praise;” one (vii.), <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שגיון‎</span> “an error,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4154src" href="#xd32e4154">6</a> referring to the miscalculation of the wicked in preparing weapons against the innocent,
which weapons are turned against themselves; and six are superscribed <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מכתם‎</span> “a jewel.” Such a jewel is the Psalmist’s “faith in God,” that inspires him with
hope and pure joy in the midst of misfortune.
</p>
<p>The headings include also instructions for the singers and references to the musical
instruments which are to <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>be used. The most general term is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למנצח‎</span> “to the chief,” <i>scil.</i>, of the singers or Levites; it refers to the chief of a particular division of the
Levites if it is followed by a qualifying phrase, and to the chief of all the Levites
if it is not followed by any qualification. The term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למנצח‎</span> describes the psalm as a Temple-song, although this may not have been its original
object. Even poems which have been composed by David on certain personal events became—perhaps
slightly modified—national songs, and formed part of the public service. The adaptation
was easy, because these historical psalms rarely contain any allusion to the particular
event mentioned in the superscription.
</p>
<p>The term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למנצח‎</span> is qualified by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על נגינת‎</span> “on a stringed instrument,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נגינת‎</span> being the particular instrument of the Levites, of whom this <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנצח‎</span> was the master<span class="corr" id="xd32e4187" title="Source: ,">.</span> The term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בנגינות‎</span> which in several psalms follows the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למנצח‎</span> is grammatically unconnected with the latter; it means “on stringed instruments,”
and is the instruction for the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנצח‎</span>. There were several kinds of such instruments; two kinds are named <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמינית‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גתית‎</span> “the <i>neginath</i> with eight strings” or “chords,” and “the <i>gittith</i>” coming from Gath, a town in the land of the Philistines. Other kinds of musical
instruments are <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נהילות‎</span> (v.), <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מחלת‎</span> (liii.), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלמות‎</span> (xlvi.); these are hollow flute-like instruments, also called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נבלים‎</span> (1 Chron. xv. 20). In some cases the division of Levites is named instead of the
instrument: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ידותון‎</span> “Jeduthun” (xxxix., lxii. and lxxvii.; comp. 1 Chron. xxv. 3); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לבני קרח‎</span> “to the sons of Korah” (xlii. to xlix., and lxxxiv. to lxxxviii.); once the direction
occurs <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לענות‎</span> (lxxxviii.), “to sing alternately,” referring to <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>the two divisions of Levites headed by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הימן האזרחי‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איתן האזרחי‎</span> “the Ezrahite Heman,” and “the Ezrahite Ethan” (lxxxviii. and lxxxix.).
</p>
<p>A few terms are met with in the headings which describe the contents of the psalm
in a poetical style. Such are (<i>a.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שושן עדות‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ששנים עדות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ששנים‎</span> (lx., lxxx., xlv., and lxix.), “Testimony for the lily or lilies,” or “for lilies.”
The poet calls by this name the flower of the nation, the meek and God-fearing, who
are under the special protection of God, and are destined to be crowned in the end
with glory and victory, (<i>b.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אילת השחר‎</span> (xxii.), “The strength of the dawn.” The phrase refers to the strength given to the
sufferer in the darkness of his despair by the awakening of his faith in God, which
is compared by the poet to the dawn as the forerunner of daylight, (<i>c.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל תשחת‎</span> “Do not destroy” (lvii., lviii., lix., and lxxv.). By this heading the author indicates
that the psalm is a protest against the self-confidence of the wicked in the success
of their wickedness, either with reference to their evil designs against the author
himself, or to their plans in general. (<i>d.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יונת אלם רחקים‎</span> “Dove in the force of those far,” scil., from God (lvi.). The psalm contains the
expression of David’s faith in God when he was caught by the Philistines in Gath.
</p>
<p>In some of the headings the event is mentioned which prompted the Psalmist to compose
the psalm: David’s flight from Jerusalem when Absalom rebelled against him (iii.);
the slander of the Benjamite Kush (vii.); the death of Labben (ix.); rescue from the
hands of Saul and other enemies (xiii.); dedication of the house (xxx.); David’s escape
from Abimelech, king <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>of the Philistines (xxxiv.); his capture by the Philistines in Gath (lvi.); his stay
in the cave of Adullam (lvii., cxlii.); danger of being put to death by the servants
of Saul (lix.); war with Aram and Edom (lx.); sojourn in the wilderness of Judah (lxiii.).
</p>
<p>The order of the Psalms is not chronological; <i>e.g.</i>, chap. iii. refers to the rebellion of Absalom, whilst chap, cxlii. was composed
before the death of Saul. The principle which guided the collector in fixing the place
of each psalm is not known. But it is certainly not the result of mere chance that
the first two psalms speak of the Law of God, and of the punishment of those who rebel
against God and against His anointed; and that the last psalm calls upon all to praise
God with all their soul: “Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord, Hallelujah!”
Nor is it mere chance that the psalms are divided, like the Law, into five groups
or books, each one ending with a doxology. It is possible that the psalms were recited
or sung at the public service in a manner corresponding to the reading of the Law
and the Prophets.
</p>
<p>The first two books contain most of the psalms superscribed <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לדוד‎</span> “by David,” but there are also some in the other books (one in III., two in IV.,
fourteen in V.). At the end of the second book (lxxii. 20) the following words are
added: “The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended;” <i>i.e.</i>, the hope which has just been expressed in the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וימלא כבוד יי את כל הארץ‎</span> “And the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of God,” forms the aim and end
of all the prayers of David, the son of Jesse. The verse does not mean that the first
seventy-two chapters of the Psalms contain all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>prayers of David, as there are several psalms of David between chaps, lxxiii. and
cl.
</p>
<p>The Psalms were composed by David and other authors partly for private use, partly
for the public service in the Temple and other places of worship. Of those that were
originally for private use some were subsequently adapted for public service, and
even those intended from the beginning for public worship were adapted to the different
modes of recitation or singing. The Book of Psalms includes, therefore, two recensions
of several chapters; <i>e.g.</i>, xiv. and liii.; xviii. and 2 Sam. xxii.; lx. 7–14 and cviii. 7–14; lvii. 8–12 and
cviii. 2–6; cv. 1–15 and 1 Chron. xvi. 8–22; xcvi. and 1 Chron. xvi. 23–33; cxxxv.
and cxxxvi.
</p>
<p>A considerable portion of our daily prayers consists of psalms. We distinguish the
following groups:—(<i>a.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסוקי דזמרא‎</span> “Verses of song,” Ps. cxlv. to cl.; to which the following are added on Sabbaths
and Festivals: xix., xxxiv., xc, xci., cxxxv., cxxxvi. (called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלל הגדול‎</span> “the great Hallel”), xxxiii., xcii., and xciii. (<i>b.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיר של יום‎</span> “Song of the day;” a different psalm is recited each day of the week after the morning
prayer in the following order: xxiv., xlviii., lxxxii., xciv., lxxxi., xciii., xcii.
(<i>c.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת שבת‎</span> “Friday evening psalms,” xcv. to xcix. (<i>d.</i>) Sabbath afternoon psalms: civ., cxx. to cxxxiv. (<i>e.</i>) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלל‎</span> “Praise,” cxiii. to cxviii. (<i>f.</i>) Penitential psalms after evening prayer on week-days, in the following order: xxv.,
xxxii., xxxviii., li., lxxxvi.

<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.2">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משלי‎</span> <i>Proverbs</i> of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. The Book of Proverbs belongs to those
Biblical books which are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספרי חכמה‎</span> “books of wisdom.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>They appeal to the reason of man, and do not support their words by the authority
of Revelation, although the authors and those who gave them the final shape were inspired
and guided by the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח ה׳‎</span> “the divine spirit.” The commandments of God and His ways are referred to as the
safest guide for man in all conditions of life. Three books are included in this class:
Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes.
</p>
<p>“The Proverbs of Solomon” are divided into the following six sections:—(<i>A.</i>) Introduction, i. to ix.; (<i>B.</i>) Collection of Proverbs: (<i>a.</i>) Proverbs of Solomon, x. to xxii. 16; (<i>b.</i>) Words of the Wise, xxii. 17 to xxiv. 22; (<i>c.</i>) Second group of Words of the Wise, <span class="corr" id="xd32e4354" title="Corrected by author from: xxv.">23 to</span> 34; (<i>d.</i>) Proverbs of Solomon collected by the men of Hezekiah, xxv. to xxviii.; (<i>e.</i>) Words of Agur-bin-yakeh, xxx.; (<i>f.</i>) Words of Lemuel, xxxi.
</p>
<p>The fourth section (chaps, xxv. to xxix.) is introduced by the following superscription:—“Also
these are the Proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, had removed.”
The men of Hezekiah seem to have been uncertain whether this section should form part
of the book, because of the seeming contradiction between the fourth and fifth verses
of the twenty-sixth chapter. The men of the Great Synagogue decided the question in
favour of its incorporation in the book, and reconciled the seeming contradiction
by their interpretation.
</p>
<p>The fifth collection of proverbs is ascribed to <i>Agur-bin-yakeh</i>, an allegorical phrase meaning “collection deserving respect.” The collection is
further called “the burden”—the usual heading of prophecies—in order to give it more
weight. Also the rest of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>superscription, “The saying of the man <i>Leïthiel</i>,<span class="corr" id="xd32e4372" title="Not in source">”</span> <i>Leïthiel ve-ucchal</i>, is of an allegorical character, signifying, “God—<i>i.e.</i>, the word of God—is my task, and I shall prevail.” The phrase is set forth more clearly
in the succeeding verses: human knowledge is insufficient, but “All the word of God
is pure; he is a shield to those who trust in him” (xxx. 5). The second half of this
collection has the heading <i>La-alukah</i>, “For a necklace” (<i>comp.</i> i. 9), similar in meaning to the heading <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מכתם‎</span> “Jewel,” in the Psalms. The form of these proverbs, based on the numbers two, three,
and four, is similar to that of the prophecies of Amos (chaps, i. and ii.). The last
collection is headed, “Words to Lemuel, the king; the burden wherewith his mother
instructed him.” The contents of the instruction is, “Be not licentious and intemperate;
help the poor and oppressed.” The name Lemuel is likewise allegorical, meaning “God-ward.”
The book concludes with the praises of a virtuous woman.
</p>
<p>(<i>A.</i>) <i>Introduction.</i>—The object of the book is set forth in verses 2 to 7 of the first chapter as follows:
“To make man know wisdom and instruction, comprehend words of understanding, and take
the instruction of acting wisely, with justice, judgment, and righteousness; to give
skill to the simple; to the young knowledge and discretion; that the wise may hear
and increase doctrine, and the prudent acquire cleverness to understand proverb and
figure, the words of wise men and their allegories. <i>The beginning of knowledge is the fear of the Lord; wisdom and instruction fools despise.</i>” This last sentence is the basis of the book. Without fear of the Lord all knowledge
and wisdom will prove <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>insufficient for establishing man’s true happiness. The Introduction consists of several
connected addresses, in which the author persuades the reader to listen to his advice,
and keep away from wicked people before it is too late. He exhorts man to entrust
himself to the guidance of the Lord, and not to rely on his own understanding. “<i>Be not wise in thine eyes, fear the Lord, and depart from evil</i>” (iii. 7). He warns against bad society, against becoming security for debtors, and
against idleness. The two ways open to man are allegorically represented by two women,
the one wise, the other foolish; the one leading to happiness, the other to ruin;
each one inviting man to her house, and displaying in the very act of invitation her
full character.
</p>
<p>(<i>B.</i>) The collections of proverbs begin with the tenth chapter. The proverbs have the
form of parallelism, each verse being divided into two parts, mostly containing an
<span class="corr" id="xd32e4402" title="Source: anithesis">antithesis</span> illustrating the difference between the wise and the foolish, the good and the bad,
the just and the unjust, the industrious and the idle, the rich and the poor, and
the like. Each verse is a proverb by itself, and is independent of the verses which
precede and follow. There are only a few passages in which several verses are connected,
and these occur in the later collections, <i>e.g.</i>, xxii. 22–23, 24–25, 26–27; xxiii. 1–3, 4–5, 6–9, 10–11, 12–13, 20–21, 29–35; xxiv.
3–7, 10–12, 30–34; xxvii. 23–27. The whole of the thirtieth chapter consists of small
paragraphs of three or four verses, and the last chapter consists of two continuous
parts.
</p>
<p>In these collections of proverbs we find advice for <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>every condition of our life. Our relation to God is shown; how He loves the good and
just:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The way of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord; but he loveth him who pursues
righteousness” (xv. 9).
</p>
<p>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord, but the prayer of the
righteous is his pleasure” (xv. 8).
</p>
<p>“The Lord is far from the wicked, but he heareth the prayer of the righteous” (xv.
29).
</p>
<p>“To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice” (xxi. 3).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>He protects the poor, the weak, the widow, and the orphan:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“He who oppresseth the poor, blasphemeth his Maker; and he who is gracious to the
needy, honoureth him” (xiv. 31).
</p>
<p>“He who is gracious to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay him his reward”
(xix. 17).
</p>
<p>“Do not rob the poor because he is poor; and do not crush the poor in the gate, for
the Lord will plead their cause, and will take the soul of those who rob them” (xxii.
23).
</p>
<p>“The Lord will pull down the house of the proud, and will establish the border of
the widow” (xv. 25).
</p>
<p>“The rich and the poor meet; the Maker of them all is the Lord” (xxii. 2).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>He punishes the evil-doer and rewards the righteous:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Do not say, I will repay evil; hope in the Lord, and he will help thee” (xx. 22).
</p>
<p>“He who closeth his ear because of the crying of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>poor, he also will call and will not be answered” (xxi. 13).
</p>
<p>“He who keepeth a command, keepeth his soul; he who despiseth his ways shall die”
(xix. 16).
</p>
<p>“When the Lord is pleased with the ways of man, he will cause even his enemies to
make peace with him” (xvi. 7).
</p>
<p>“The Lord will not let the soul of the righteous be hungry, but the desire of the
wicked will he thrust back” (x. 3).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>He knows the heart of man:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“There is a test for silver, and a refining pot for gold; but God trieth the hearts”
(xvii. 3).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>He directs all events:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Man’s heart planneth his way, but the Lord directeth his step” (xvi. 9).
</p>
<p>“The horse is prepared for the day of war, but the victory is the Lord’s” (xxi. 31).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>His blessing is a true blessing:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and doth not increase trouble with it”
(x. 22).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>His Will alone must be obeyed:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“There is no wisdom, and no understanding, and no counsel against the Lord” (xxi.
30).
</p>
<p>“Whoso despiseth a word will be punished, but he who feareth a commandment will be
rewarded” (xiii. 13).
</p>
<p>“Without a vision the people cometh into disorder; but he who keepeth the Law, happy
is he” (xxix. 18).</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fear of the Lord is the basis of a virtuous and happy life:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (i. 7); the fountain of life (xiv.
27); the fear of the Lord adds days, but the years of the wicked will be short” (x.
27).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>According as we display wisdom or folly we make others and ourselves happy or unhappy:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“A wise son giveth joy to his father, and a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother”
(x. 1).
</p>
<p>“The wisdom of woman buildeth her house, and folly pulleth it down by her hands” (xiv.
1).
</p>
<p>“Eat, my son, honey, for it is good, and honeycomb, which is sweet for thy palate;
know that thus is wisdom for thy soul; if thou hast found it, there is a future, and
thy hope will not be cut off” (xxiv. 13, 14).
</p>
<p>“The prudent seeth evil, and is hidden; the ignorant pass by, and are punished” (xxvii.
12).
</p>
<p>“As a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman without discretion” (xi.
22).
</p>
<p>“The simple believeth every word; but the prudent man looketh well to his going” (xiv.
15).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The ways of wisdom and folly are frequently displayed in our words:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin, but he who spareth his words acts
wisely” (x. 19).
</p>
<p>“A soft answer turneth back wrath, but a harsh word raiseth anger” (xv. 1).
</p>
<p>“Also a fool when silent is considered wise; he who closeth his lips is prudent” (xvii.
28).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>“He who keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles” (xxi. 23).
</p>
<p>“By long-suffering the prince is persuaded; and a soft tongue breaketh a bone” (xxv.
15).
</p>
<p>“Answer not a fool like his folly, lest thou be equal to him. Answer a fool according
to his folly, lest he be wise in his eyes” (xxvi. 4, 5).</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.3">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Job</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איוב‎</span>—The Book of Job consists of the following three parts:—
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>Introduction</i> (i. and ii.).—God is figuratively represented as presiding over a council of ministers
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בני האלהים‎</span> “sons of God”), amongst whom also the accuser (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏השטן‎</span> “the hinderer,” one who is hostile to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>word of God) appears. While God praised the piety of Job, the accuser doubted the
purity of his heart, and suggested that if any adversity were to befall Job he would
no longer be pious; Job, exposed to hard trials, remained firm in his faith in God.
“Naked came I forth from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord
hath given, and the Lord hath taken: let the name of the Lord be praised” (i. 21).
“Skin for skin,” said the accuser, “and everything that man hath, he giveth for his
soul; but stretch now forth thy hand and touch his bone and his flesh: surely he will
take leave of thee in thy presence” (ii. 5). The trial was granted. And when Job’s
wife was surprised that Job was still holding to his integrity, adding “Take leave
of God and die,” he replied, “Thou speakest like the speaking of one of the wicked
women. Are we to accept of God the good, and shall we not accept the evil?”—“In all
this did Job not sin with his lips, and did not find fault with God” (i. 22). His
friends came to see him, but felt so distressed that they sat with him for seven days
without uttering a word.
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Discussion</i> between Job and his friends Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu; Job asserting his
innocence, and consequent inability to see the justice of his afflictions; his friends
contending that he has sinned, and has been justly punished; Elihu attempts to justify
Job’s sufferings, on the plea that they are merely a reminder sent by God that Job
has sinned, and must seek reconciliation with God, who is All-wise, All-good, and
All-powerful; God addresses Job, and shows him man’s inability to comprehend the <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>Divine power and wisdom in the creation and in the ruling of the universe; whereupon
Job repents.
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) <i>Conclusion.</i>—God rebukes the friends of Job, that they have not spoken rightly like His servant
Job (xlii. 7), and richly compensates Job for his sufferings and losses.
</p>
<p>The book has no heading, and therefore we do not know by whom or when it was written.
There is, however, a tradition, mentioned in the Talmud (Baba Bathra, p. 14<i>b</i>), that Moses wrote the Book of Job. Even about Job himself it is impossible to ascertain
at what time he lived. But the description of his riches and the length of his life
leads us to think of the time of the patriarchs. His name is mentioned only in one
other book of the Bible. The prophet Ezekiel names him together with Noah and Daniel
as a righteous man who would, by his piety, save himself in the time of general calamity,
though he would not be able to save his generation (Ezek. xiv. 14). There is also
an opinion that Job never existed at all. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איוב לא היה ולא נברא אלא משל היה‎</span> “Job never lived; nor has he had any existence; the story is all only an allegory”
(Babyl. Talm. Baba Bathra, 15<i>a</i>). This dictum can only refer to the detailed account of the manner in which the misfortune
came upon Job, and the poetical discussion of Job and his friends. But it is undeniable
that a pious man of the name of Job lived, and escaped from a calamity to which others
succumbed; since it is clear that Ezekiel refers to real and not to imaginary personages.
Job and his friends were not Israelites. The patriarch lived in the land of Uz in
Arabia; the friends came from Teman, Shuah, Naamah, and Buz, in the south, <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>east, west, and north of Uz. Like the Book of Jonah, this book conveys the lesson,
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסידי אומות העולם יש להם חלק לעולם הבא‎</span> “The pious of all nations have a portion in the world to come” (Maim., Mishneh-torah
I. Hilchoth Teshubah, iii. 5). God rewards the righteous of all nations, punishes
those among them who deserve punishment, and pardons the penitent.
</p>
<p>The introduction and conclusion are written in prose, but the principal part of the
book is poetical, and consequently parallelism is a predominant feature of the book.
</p>
<p>The following are a few sentences from the book:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” (ii. 10).
</p>
<p>“The small and great are there (in the grave), and the servant is free from his master”
(iii. 19).
</p>
<p>“Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker?”
(iv. 17).
</p>
<p>“Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening
of the Almighty” (v. 17).
</p>
<p>“Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the
days of an hireling?” (vii. 1).
</p>
<p>“He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who hath hardened himself against him,
and hath prospered?” (ix. 4).
</p>
<p>“Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him” (xiii. 15).
</p>
<p>“For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and he will rise in the end over the dust” (xix.
25).
</p>
<p>“And when my skin is gone, when worms have destroyed this body, and when my flesh
is no more, yet shall I see God” (xix. 26).
</p>
<p>“And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>that is wisdom; and to depart from evil, that is understanding” (xxviii. 28).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The following passages are noteworthy, on account of both their lofty thought and
their poetical form:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Eliphaz mildly rebukes Job, exhorting him to repentance (iv.).
</p>
<p>Job’s charge against the cruelty of his friends (v. 12–30).
</p>
<p>Bildad’s view of God’s justice (viii. 3–13).
</p>
<p>Job’s conception of God’s Omnipotence (ix. 2–12).
</p>
<p>Zophar’s explanation of God’s justice (xi. 2–7, 10–15).
</p>
<p>Job’s declaration of his faith in God (xiii. 6–16; xix. 23–27; xxiii. 3–12).
</p>
<p>Job’s confession of man’s dependence on God’s wisdom (xxviii. 1, 2, 12–28).
</p>
<p>Job’s defence of his innocence (xxxi.).
</p>
<p>Elihu’s defence of God’s justice (xxxiii. 8, 9, 12–30).
</p>
<p>Job is shown his ignorance (xxxviii. 3–24); his impotence (xl. 9–14).
</p>
<p>Job’s contrition (xlii. 2–6).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The three books, Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, are distinguished from the rest of the
Bible by their peculiar accents, which are on this account called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעמי אמ״ת‎</span> “the accents of the books, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהלים‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משלי‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איוב‎</span>.”

<p class="first"><i>The Song of Solomon</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיר השירים‎</span> (lit., The Song of Songs = the most poetical song).—The faithfulness of the beloved
to her lover, her resistance to all temptation, and the concentration of all her thoughts
on the well-being of her lover, form the theme of the book. The relation between lover
and beloved has been interpreted allegorically as representing the relation between
God and Israel. The latter remains faithful to his God, throughout all vicissitudes
of fortune. “I am <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>for my lover, and my lover is for me,” is the centre of this feeling of faith. According
to the heading and the tradition, King Solomon is the author of the book.

<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.5">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Ruth</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רות‎</span>—The book contains the history of Ruth, a Moabite woman, who, by her marriage with
Boaz, became the founder of the house of David. Elimelech of Beth-lehem in Judah,
with his wife Naomi and his two sons, left his country in time of famine in order
to stay in the land of Moab. There the two sons marry Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth.
Elimelech and the two sons die. Naomi returns to Judah; Orpah, at the request of Naomi,
remains in Moab and goes back to her family, but Ruth insists on accompanying Naomi,
saying, “Whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people
shall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest will I die, and there will
I be buried: so the Lord do to me, and more also, if ought but death will part thee
and me” (i. 16, 17).
</p>
<p>Naomi having lost her property, Ruth was obliged to glean ears of corn in the fields
in order to maintain herself and her mother-in-law. She happened to glean in the field
of Boaz, a near relative of Elimelech. Boaz having noticed her, and having heard of
her conduct toward Naomi, married her; his son was Obed; the son of the latter was
Jesse, the father of David. Thus the virtues of Ruth, modesty, faithfulness, and industry,
were rewarded; this is one of the lessons derived from the book. The principal object
of the book, however, is to show the origin of the house of David.

Jeremiah composed these lamentations. The first four chapters are alphabetical; in
the third chapter there are three verses for each letter; the fifth chapter is not
alphabetical. The cause of the lamentations is the catastrophe of the kingdom of Judah
through the victories of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, although neither Nebuchadnezzar
nor Babylon is mentioned in the book.

<p class="first"><i>Ecclesiates</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קהלת‎</span>—This book contains reflections on the vanity of man’s labours and plans; whatever
man aims at as the source of his happiness and blessing proves in the end useless
and deceptive. Man is disappointed to find everything transient; he discovers just
people in misery, and wicked people in apparent comfort; he begins to doubt whether
virtue and wisdom are really conducive to true happiness. Thus man, left to himself,
is at a loss to find the right way to happiness. The author therefore concludes his
reflections with the exhortation: “The end of the word in which everything is heard
is, <i>Fear God, and keep His commandments, for that is the whole of man.</i> For every deed will God bring to account, together with every hidden thought, whether
good or bad” (xii. 13, 14).

<p>Koheleth mentioned in the heading is King Solomon. The philosophical reflections are
frequently intermixed with proverb-like lessons and maxims, of which the following

of spirit” (iv. 6).
</p>
<p>“Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and readiness to hear is better
than the fools’ giving of sacrifice; for they consider not that they do evil” (iv.
17).

<p>“Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before
God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few” (v.
1).
</p>
<p>“When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in
fools: pay that which thou hast vowed” (v. 3).
</p>
<p>“A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death better than the
day of one’s birth” (vii. 1).
</p>
<p>“Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools”

<p class="first"><i>Daniel</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דניאל‎</span>—The author of this book is not named. The book is called Daniel because it contains
the history and the visions of Daniel. According to a tradition mentioned in the Babylonian
Talmud (Baba Bathra, 15<i>a</i>), the men of the Great Synagogue wrote or edited the book probably from trustworthy
traditions, partly written, partly oral. The last six <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>chapters seem to have been written by Daniel himself; he speaks in them of himself
in the first person.
</p>
<p>The object of the book is to show that God is the Ruler of the Universe. The author,
therefore, gives, on the one hand, examples of men of great piety and genuine faith
in God—Daniel and his friends; and, on the other hand, examples of men of great wickedness—Nebuchadnezzar
and Belshazzar; the former enjoyed glorious victories, the latter received their due
punishment. The style is throughout bold and emphatic; the frequent heaping of synonyms
is to serve the purpose of emphasis. In the last chapters the author shows that the
misdeeds of the wicked and the sufferings of the pious are foreseen by God, and that
both the punishment of the former and the redemption of the latter form part of the
Divine plan in the government of mankind. We are thus exhorted to remain firm in our
faith in time of oppression, and to wait patiently for deliverance, which is sure
to come.
</p>
<p>Although Daniel belonged to those distinguished men to whom God communicated coming
events in visions, he is not classed among the prophets, because he had no Divine
message to bring to his fellow-men, and he was not charged to address them in the
name of God. Daniel was brought to Babylon, together with other captives, in the third
year of Jehoiakim, and remained there during the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar,
Darius the Mede, and the first years of Cyrus the Persian. He distinguished himself
by great piety and wisdom, so that in a prophecy of Ezekiel (xiv. 14), in the sixth
year of the exile of King Jehoiachin, he is mentioned, together with Noah and Job,
as famous for piety, as one <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>of those whom God protects from danger because of their righteousness, although their
piety could not save their fellow-men. The same prophet mentions him as a wise man
(xxviii. 3).
</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts: (A.) An account written in Chaldee of Daniel’s
wisdom and piety, with a Hebrew Introduction (i. to vi.). (2.) The visions of Daniel
in Chaldee and Hebrew (vii. to xii.). In the introductory chapter the author narrates
the principal facts of the training of Daniel in Babylonian wisdom, and his great
success at the court of Nebuchadnezzar. Then follows the Chaldee portion, including
the following subjects:—
</p>
<p>(1.) <i>Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream.</i>—The king demands that the sages initiated in Babylonian wisdom shall tell him his
dream, which he himself has forgotten, and its interpretation. They cannot do it,
and many of them are put to death. Daniel arrests the slaughter; for he prays to God,
and God reveals to him the king’s dream.
</p>
<p>When Daniel appeared before the king he began thus: “The secret which the king wants
to know, no wise men can tell. But there is a God in heaven, the revealer of secrets,
and He has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will come to pass in the remote future”
(ii. 27, 28). The dream was this: He saw a big statue, its head of gold, breast and
arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs and feet of iron and clay. A large
stone fell upon the legs of the statue, broke them, and the whole statue fell together
and was crushed into pieces; then the stone grew larger, and filled the whole earth.
The following was the interpretation of the vision: The statue represented a series
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>earthly kingdoms; the gold was Nebuchadnezzar, the silver referred to his successors,
the brass to the Persian government, the iron to the Greek, and the mixture of iron
and clay to the kingdoms that would then follow, all of which would ultimately be
overthrown, and the Divine kingdom would then be recognised by all. Daniel was greatly
rewarded; he and his friends received high positions in the government of the empire.
</p>
<p>(2.) Nebuchadnezzar erected a large statue, and commanded that at certain times all
should worship it; disobedience was to be punished with death. Daniel’s friends did
not bow before it, and were accused before the king. They said to the king, “There
is a God whom we worship; <span class="corr" id="xd32e4791" title="Source: he">He</span> can save us from the burning furnace and from thy hand, O king. And if <span class="corr" id="xd32e4794" title="Source: he">He</span> does not save us, let it be known to thee, O king, that we shall not worship thy
god, and not bow down before the golden image which thou hast set up” (iii. 17, 18).
</p>
<p>They were thrown into the furnace, and miraculously saved. Thereupon Nebuchadnezzar
sends letters to all the peoples of his empire, testifying to the greatness of God,
and narrating what wonderful thing had occurred to him. He had a strange dream, and
none but Daniel was able to interpret it; the dream was literally fulfilled according
to Daniel’s interpretation. The dream, which, after the manner of such phenomena,
introduced and mingled together diverse elements, was this: He saw a high tree with
many branches and much foliage. Suddenly an angel from heaven came, and ordered the
tree to be cut down, but the root to be left for seven seasons, bound with fetters
of iron and brass, in the midst of the grass of the field. The heart of man <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>was to be taken from it, and replaced by a heart of beasts. The interpretation was,
that the mighty Nebuchadnezzar would be removed from the society of man, and live
like a beast with beasts for seven seasons. This happened to him just when he was
boasting of his greatness and said, “Is this not great Babylon which I have built
for the royal house, in my great power, and to my great glory?” (iv. 27). He was humbled,
recognised the dominion of God over the whole universe, and was again, after seven
seasons, restored to his former power and dignity. “Praised be God,” he exclaimed,
“whose deeds are all truth, and whose ways are justice, and who can humble those who
walk in pride” (<i>Ibid.</i> 34).
</p>
<p>(3.) King Belshazzar, in the midst of a banquet, at which the holy vessels of the
Temple in Jerusalem were used, perceived a hand writing on the wall opposite him strange
signs which none could read. Daniel was called, and read the writing: “<i>Mene, mene, tekel upharsin</i>,” and explained it thus: The days of thy government are counted and brought to a
close; thou hast been weighed and found wanting; thy kingdom is divided, and given
to the Medes and Persians (v. 25–28). That same night King Belshazzar was killed,
and the Mede Darius was made king (v. 30–vi. 1).
</p>
<p>(4.) King Darius, advised by his officers, who sought to find an opportunity for overthrowing
Daniel, issued an order, that within thirty days no god or other being except Darius
should be prayed to, and that transgressors against this decree should be punished
with death. Daniel prayed to God three times a day <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>at his open window. He was thrown into the lions’ den; but God protected him from
the mouths of the lions. When he was taken out of the den, his accusers were thrown
into it, and the lions immediately devoured them. Thus Darius was forced publicly
to recognise the Omnipotence of God.
</p>
<p>(5.) A dream of Daniel is related by the author in Daniel’s own words, who had written
down the dream, and explained the chief points.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4813src" href="#xd32e4813">8</a> The following is the dream:—He saw four beasts, viz., a lion, a bear with three ribs
in its mouth, a leopard with four wings and four heads, and a fourth beast with iron
teeth and ten horns, one of the horns being small, but having “a mouth speaking haughtily.”
In a court of justice the latter beast was sentenced to death, and the other beasts
were to be deprived of their power; but respite was granted to them for a time and
a season. The royal power was given to one who approached the judge appearing like
a human being, and not like any of the beasts. His rule was to remain for ever. The
interpretation of the dream is this: There will be four different kingdoms; out of
the fourth ten different kingdoms will be formed. One of these will haughtily presume
to oppose the Will of God, and to abolish the festivals and the religion of the holy
ones. It will succeed for “a season, seasons, and half a season,” and will then be
utterly destroyed, whilst the rule of “the holy ones”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4816src" href="#xd32e4816">9</a> will in the end be firmly established and continue for ever.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>The indefinite character of the vision shows that it was intended to apply to all
those oppressors of the Jews who at different times have presumed, or still presume,
to be able to abolish the religion of “the holy ones.” Whether the oppression lasts
a “season of seasons” (or “a season and seasons”), <i>i.e.</i>, a very long time, or “half a season,” <i>i.e.</i>, a very short time, the holy ones are exhorted to remain firm in their faith in God’s
justice. The truth of this vision is especially illustrated by the failure of the
attempts of Antiochus Epiphanes after a temporary success. More definite are the numbers
2300 “evening-mornings” (viii. 14), 1290 days and 1335 days (xii. 11, 12); but the
absence of any further description as to the date of the first of these days leaves
even to these numbers a certain degree of indetermination. From the context we learn
that they are somehow connected with the persecution to which the Jews were subjected
by Antiochus Epiphanes. 2300 days (or 6 years 110 days) passed between the decree
of the Syrian king enforcing idolatry and the peace with Lysias granting religious
liberty; there were 1290 days between the decree forbidding the practice of the holy
religion and the enforcement of idolatry in the Temple of Jerusalem, and 1335 days
is the period between the latter event and the death of Antiochus.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>(B.) The second part contains visions of Daniel as written down by himself.
</p>
<p>(1.) In the third year of Belshazzar, Daniel had the following vision:—Being in Susan,
in the province of Elam, near the river Ulai, he saw a ram with <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>two unequal horns pushing towards west, north, and south. From the west came a goat
with one horn, and overthrew the ram; in the place of the one horn four horns grew
up in all directions; there was one small horn which pushed on against the south,
the east, and Palestine; it rose even against the host of heaven and the chief of
the host, and destroyed his holy place. Daniel heard one holy one saying to another,
“This state of things will last till ‘evening-morning 2300.’ ” The angel Gabriel gave
him the interpretation of the vision: The ram represented the empire of the Medes
and the Persians, the goat that of the Greeks, out of which four kingdoms would be
formed; in one of these a wicked king would venture to rise against the Prince of
princes, but his power would in the end be destroyed. Daniel was told to keep the
vision secret, for it referred to a distant future (viii. 26).
</p>
<p>(2.) In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, Daniel
reflected on the seventy years of exile foretold by Jeremiah, and fervently prayed
to God for pardon and the restoration of Jerusalem. At the end of his prayer the angel
Gabriel appeared to him, and told him that the hoped-for restoration would not take
place before the lapse of seventy weeks of trouble and anxiety. There would elapse
seven weeks before the “princely anointed” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משיח נגיד‎</span>) led the Jews back to Palestine; sixty-two weeks of trouble and anxiety were predicted
for the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple; and one week’s misery
on the arrival of a new prince or governor, who would strengthen the covenant of the
enemies and <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>entirely suspend the Divine Service in the Temple for a short time.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4841src" href="#xd32e4841">10</a>
</p>
<p>(3.) In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, Daniel, after three weeks’ mourning
and fasting, had the following vision on the twenty-fourth day of the first month:—He
saw near the river Tigris (Hiddekel) a man of extraordinary appearance, who told him
that he came in answer to his prayers; that for twenty-one days (x. 13) he was opposed
by the prince of the kingdom of Persia, and had on his side only one of the princes,
Michael. Future events are foretold: the fall of Persia, the division of the Greek
kingdom, the wars between the Northern country (Syria) and the Southern (Egypt), the
troubles of the Jews, the ultimate deliverance of the Jews out of danger, and the
glorious victory of the teachers “who taught many, and led them to righteousness”
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המשבילים ומצדקי הרבים‎</span> xii. 3). When Daniel asked, “Till when have we to wait for the end of these wondrous
things?” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עד מתי קץ הפלאות‎</span> <i>Ibid.</i> 6), he was told, “After a season, seasons, and a half (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למועד מועדים וחצי‎</span> <i>Ibid.</i> 7)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4860src" href="#xd32e4860">11</a> all these things will come to an end.” He further asks, “What then?” He is told,
“The things must remain sealed till the time of the end (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עד עת קץ‎</span> <i>Ibid.</i> 9), when the wise and good (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd32e4870" title="Source: משכילים">משכלים</span>‎</span>) will understand them.” The vision ends with the words addressed to Daniel: “But
thou go toward the end, and thou wilt rest, and rise for thy lot at the end of the
days” (xii. 13).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.10">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Ezra</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עזרא‎</span>—The Book of Ezra relates the first return of the Jews under Zerubbabel from Babylon
to Palestine by the permission of King Cyrus (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כורש‎</span>) of Persia, the construction of the altar, the foundation and the building of the
Temple by permission of King Darius. It also describes the second settlement of Jews
from Babylon in Palestine under Ezra, the Scribe, in the reign of Artaxerxes, and
his energy in purifying the community from intermarriages with heathen people. The
book is written in Hebrew, with the exception of iv. 8–vii. 27, which includes several
documents written in Chaldee by the Persian kings. The author of the book is probably
Ezra; he speaks of himself in the first person (vii. 28; viii. 1, &amp;c.); he is also
named as the author of the book in the Babylonian Talmud; and lastly, the name of
the book is Ezra, although Ezra is only mentioned in the second half of the book.
The special merit of Ezra was the promotion of the study of the Law; his name is followed
by the title, “A ready scribe of the Law of Moses” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סופר מהיר בתורת ה׳‎</span> vii. 6), and “Scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord and His statutes
for Israel” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר דברי מצות ה׳ וחקיו על ישראל‎</span> vii. 11); the task he set to himself was “to study the Law of God (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לדרוש את תורת ה׳‎</span>), and to practise it, and to teach in Israel Law and judgment” (vii. 10).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch1.2.9.11">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Nehemiah</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נחמיה‎</span>—The heading probably indicates the author, “Words of Nehemiah, son of Hachaliah.”
<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4904src" href="#xd32e4904">12</a> The book contains the history of Nehemiah’s visit to Jerusalem by the permission
of King Artaxerxes, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>the building of the walls of Jerusalem under Nehemiah’s supervision, in spite of the
opposition of Sanballat and Tobiah the Ammonite; his example of disinterestedness
and of liberality towards the poor, which is followed by the princes and the rich;
the reading and expounding of the Law by Ezra; the celebration of the festival of
the first of Tishri and of Tabernacles; the renewal of the covenant “to walk in the
Law of God, which was given through Moses the servant of God,” to keep Sabbath, to
abstain from intermarrying with the heathen, and to contribute towards maintaining
the Sanctuary; the provision for filling Jerusalem with inhabitants by selecting by
lot one-tenth of the general population to dwell in the holy city; the dedication
of the walls of Jerusalem; and Nehemiah’s energy in enforcing the laws of Sabbath
and of marriages. The two books Ezra and Nehemiah are also called by some “two books
of Ezra,” and by some “the book of Ezra.” Nehemiah is written in Hebrew.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 last-child section" id="ch1.2.9.12">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Chronicles</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברי הימים‎</span>—The two books of Chronicles contain the following three parts: (1) Genealogical tables
(I., i.–ix.); (2) the history of the death of King Saul, the history of David and
Solomon (I., x.–II., ix.); (3) the history of the kingdom of Judah from Rehoboam till
the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (II., x.–xxxvi.). Special attention
has been given by the author to the arrangements made at various periods for the Temple-service,
by King David (I., xxiii. <i>sqq.</i>), King Hezekiah (II., xxix.), and King Josiah (II., xxxiv., xxxv.).
</p>
<p>The author is not named in the book; according to the tradition it is Ezra. As the
genealogical tables <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>give six generations after Zerubbabel (I., iii. 19–24), we may assume that the author
wrote about fifty years after Zerubbabel; that is, the last years of Ezra and Nehemiah.
</p>
<p>The sources from which the author derived his information were, besides the Biblical
books, the following:—The book of the kings of Judah; the book of the kings of Israel,
registers probably kept in the Temple archives; the histories of Samuel the Seer,
Nathan the prophet, and Gad the Seer; the prophecy of Ahijah of Shilo; the visions
of Jedo; the Midrash of the prophet Iddo; the history of Jehu, son of Hanani; the
history of Isaiah, son of Amoz, and the history of Hozai.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10">This is the last book of the series of Holy Writings. Books that were written later,
whatever their intrinsic value may be, were not considered holy, and were not received
into this collection. There are a number of books known as Apocrypha (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גנוזים‎</span>), lit. “Hidden things” or “put aside,” that is, kept separate from the Holy Scriptures.
They were not considered as genuine, as they consisted of a mixture of fact and fiction,
truth and error. They were, however, not suppressed or forbidden; in the Talmud several
quotations from these books are met with. The following are the principal books belonging
to the Apocrypha:—
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.1">(1.) <i>The Book of Wisdom</i>, or the Wisdom of Solomon. Wisdom based on the fear of God, and guided by it, is
the source of man’s true happiness, and if wisdom and virtue are not rewarded by success
in mundane affairs, the reward is sure to come in the future world. This is the quintessence
of the lessons taught in this book. <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>The kings and potentates of the earth are frequently exhorted to be just and kind
towards their people, and to remember that they are but human beings, weak and mortal,
like the rest of mankind; wisdom alone can raise them to higher perfection and happiness.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline, and the care of discipline
is love. And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is
the assurance of incorruption. And incorruption maketh us near God. Therefore the
desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom. If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres,
O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore” (vi. 17–21).
</p>
<p>“For regarding not wisdom, they got not only this hurt, that they knew not the things
which were good, but also left behind them to the world a memorial of their foolishness,
so that in the things wherein they offended they could not so much as be hid. But
wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her. When the righteous fled from
his brother’s wrath, she guided him into right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God,
and gave him knowledge of holy things that made him rich in his travels, and multiplied
the fruit of his labours” (x. 8–10).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.2">(2.) <i>The Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach.</i>—Proverbs, maxims, and moral lessons collected by Joshua (Jesus), son of Sirach of
Jerusalem. After having studied the Law, the Prophets, and the other Holy Writings,
he thought it advisable to write a book on knowledge and wisdom for those who seek
instruction, in order to lead them to greater obedience to the Law. Joshua’s grandson
migrated from Palestine to Egypt, and translated <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>the work of his grandfather into Greek for those who could not read the Hebrew original.
The translation was made in the thirty-eighth year of King Euergetes II. of Egypt
(3888 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>).
</p>
<p>The contents of the book are similar to those of the Proverbs of Solomon: the author
recommends the acquisition of wisdom, patience, faith in God, meekness, obedience
of children to parents, charity, cautiousness in the use of the tongue, temperance,
honesty, and the like. As models of piety and wisdom the principal heroes in the Bible,
from Adam to Joshua, son of Jehozadak, are named, and in addition to these Simon the
high priest.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation. Set thy
heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble. Cleave
unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. Whatsoever
is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low
estate. For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.
Believe in him, and he will help thee: order thy way aright, and trust in him” (ii.
1–6).
</p>
<p>“But he that giveth his mind to the law of the Most High, and is occupied in the meditation
thereof, will seek out the wisdom of the most ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.
He will keep the sayings of most renowned men, and where subtle parables are, He will
be there also. He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and be conversant
in dark parables” (xxxix. 1–3).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.3">(3.) <i>Baruch.</i>—The book may be divided into two <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>parts. In the first part Baruch, son of Nerijah, the amanuensis of the prophet Jeremiah,
addresses, in Babylon, Jehoiachin, the captive king of Judah, and the other captive
Jews; they send money to Jerusalem for sacrifices, with a letter exhorting their brethren
to return to God, and comforting them with the prospect of a glorious future. The
second part contains a letter of Jeremiah to his brethren in Jerusalem denouncing
idolatry.
</p>
<p>The letters are probably not genuine, not being in harmony with the facts related
in the books of Jeremiah and Kings.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.4">(4.) <i>The Book of Tobit.</i>—Tobit, of the tribe of Naphtali, a good and pious man, was one of those who were
carried away into the Assyrian captivity. One of the charitable acts to which he devoted
himself with special zeal was the burying of the dead. Twice was misfortune brought
upon him for practising this deed of piety. Once he had to flee, and to remain away
from his family in misery and want, and a second time something fell into his eyes,
and he became blind. In both cases he was saved out of his trouble, and was greatly
rewarded for his patience, his faith in God, and his perseverance in the performance
of the Divine commandments. The author of the book is not known.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.5">(5.) <i>Judith.</i>—An incident of Jewish history during the Persian rule. Judith is set forth as an
ideal of piety, beauty, courage, and chastity. Holofernes, a general in the service
of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyria, conquers many lands, but meets with vigorous resistance
in Judea; he besieges Bethulia and endeavours to suppress the Jewish religion. He
falls by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>hands of Judith. Thus the stratagem and the courage of the Jewish heroine, combined
with the plans of Divine justice, frustrated the wicked plans of the heathen conqueror,
and delivered the besieged city.
</p>
<p>(6.) Additions to the Books of Daniel and Ezra, containing—
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) The song of the three men in the furnace (Dan. iii.).
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) The false charges brought against Susanna, and her deliverance through Daniel.
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) Bel and the Dragon. Cyrus, the Persian, worshipped these idols, but was convinced
by Daniel that they had no claim whatever to man’s worship.
</p>
<p>(<i>d.</i>) The apocryphal Book of Esdras, containing portions of the Books of Chronicles, Ezra,
and Nehemiah; only chaps. iii. and iv. being original. In these it is related how
Zerubbabel distinguished himself before King Darius in describing Woman and Truth
as the mightiest rulers of mankind, and thus obtained permission to return to Palestine
and rebuild the Temple. A second apocryphal Book of Esdras is named, in which Ezra
is represented as a prophet addressing his brethren in the name of God, and telling
them the visions he had.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.10.7">(7.) <i>The Books of the Maccabees.</i>—Three books containing the history of the Maccabees, and various episodes of the
wars against the Syrian oppressors, both legendary and historical.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.11"><i>Sixth Principle.</i>—“<i>I firmly believe that all the words of the Prophets are true.</i>”
</p>
<p>By “the Prophets” the prophets thus designated in <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>the Bible are to be understood who have proved themselves to be the true messengers
of God, and were accepted as such by the people. They either counselled the people
what to do under various circumstances, in times of peace and in times of war, in
times of security and in times of danger, or they announced the coming catastrophe
as a punishment sent by the Almighty for disobedience, and foretold future happiness
and prosperity in case of improvement and return to God. Those prophecies that referred
to the proximate future have been verified by subsequent events, and so also will
those prophecies that refer to the remote future and have not yet been fulfilled.
</p>
<p>“A prophet out of thy midst, of thy brethren, like unto me, will the Lord thy God
raise up unto thee; unto him ye shall hearken” (Deut. xviii. 15). “The former things,
behold, they are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they will spring
forth, I shall let you hear” (Isa. xlii. 9). “I have also spoken unto the prophets,
and I have multiplied visions, and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes”
(Hosea xii. 11). “And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a
prophet was he preserved” (<i>Ibid.</i> 14).
</p>
<p>In the sixth article we declare our belief in the fact that the Almighty has communicated
His Will to human beings, although we are incapable of forming a clear and definite
idea of the manner in which such communication took place. The selection of the individual
for the office of a prophet, as well as of the time, the place, and the object of
the Divine communication, is dependent solely on the Will of God, whose Wisdom <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>and Plan no mortals are able to fathom. We know only the fact that Malachi closed
the series of Prophets, but are ignorant of the reason why since Malachi no human
being has “found a vision from the Lord.” Mankind is, however, not altogether deprived
of the benefit of prophecy; the holy book need only be opened, and the message of
the prophets is heard once more.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.12"><i>Seventh Principle.</i>—“<i>I firmly believe that the prophecy of Moses was a direct prophecy, and that Moses
was the chief of the prophets, both of those who preceded him and of those who followed
him.</i>”
</p>
<p>All that has been said with regard to the sixth article applies to the prophecy of
Moses. There is, however, this distinction between the words of Moses and the words
of other prophets:—whilst other prophets chiefly addressed their own generation, blaming
their brethren for disobedience to the Divine Law, threatening with punishments and
comforting with blessings of which experience was to be made in the remote future,
Moses addresses all times and generations, communicating to them laws “for all generations,”
“everlasting statutes,” “the things which have been revealed for us and our children
for ever.” He is therefore proclaimed by the Almighty as the greatest prophet. <span class="corr" id="xd32e5022" title="Source: Whem">When</span> Miriam and Aaron had spoken against Moses, God rebuked them, saying, “If there be
among you a prophet of the Lord, I will make myself known unto him in a vision, I
will speak with him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all
my house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches;
and the form of the Lord shall he behold” (Num. xii. 6–8). The <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>Torah concludes with the praise of Moses, as follows: “And there hath not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face: in all the
signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh,
and to all his servants, and to all his land; and in all the mighty hand, and in all
the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel” (Deut. xxxiv. 10–12).
</p>
<p>The phrase “knew God face to face,” or “I will speak with him mouth to mouth,” and
the like, denotes figuratively “the clearest, most direct, and most simple communication,”
the figure being taken from the way in which men communicate to each other things
when they desire to be clearly understood, and to leave no doubt as to the truth and
the meaning of the communication.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.13"><i>Eighth Principle.</i>—“<i>I firmly believe that the Law which we possess now is the same which has been given
to Moses on Sinai.</i>”
</p>
<p>The whole Torah, including both history and precepts, is of Divine origin; nothing
is contained in the Torah that was not revealed to Moses by the Almighty, although
we do not know in what manner Moses received the information. The history of preceding
generations was probably handed down to his time by tradition; in part it may have
been contained in documents then extant, as is likely to have been the case with the
various genealogies mentioned in the Pentateuch. But it was by Divine inspiration
that Moses knew to distinguish between truth and error, between fiction and reality.
The events recorded in the Pentateuch are to demonstrate and to keep constantly <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>before our eyes the fact that there is a higher Power that ordains the fate of men
and nations according to their deeds. Everything is described in a simple and objective
manner. Although the whole Torah is the work of Moses, the great prophet speaks of
himself everywhere in the third person, except in the Book of Deuteronomy, in which
he records his addresses to the people in the last year of his life.
</p>
<p>The last few verses, which describe the death of Moses, the mourning of the Israelites
for the death of their teacher, and his exaltation above all other prophets, have
been added to the Torah by Joshua the son of Nun, the leader of the Israelites after
the death of Moses. Thus, from that day until the present the Torah, in its integrity,
has been in the hands of the children of Israel. It was guarded as the most valuable
national treasure, and although there have been not a few generations which were corrupt
and idolatrous, Israel has never been entirely bereaved of pious and faithful worshippers
of the true God; and when in one generation or period the study and the practice of
the Torah were neglected, they were resumed with greater vigour and zeal in the next.
</p>
<p>There is a tradition recorded in the Talmud that after the Babylonian exile Ezra,
the Scribe, replaced the ancient Hebrew characters in which the Torah had originally
been written by the square characters still in use. Nothing, however, was omitted
from or added to the contents of the Torah, when the present forms of the letters
were introduced by Ezra. In the scrolls of the Law the letters were not provided with
vowel-points and accents; the manner in which the words, <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>phrases, and sentences were to be read was a subject of oral teaching. Also many explanations
and details of the laws were supplemented by oral teaching; they were handed down
by word of mouth from generation to generation, and only after the destruction of
the second Temple were they committed to writing. The latter are, nevertheless, called
Oral Law (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה שבעל פה‎</span>), as distinguished from the Torah or Written Law (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה שבכתב‎</span>), which from the first was committed to writing. Those oral laws which were revealed
to Moses on Mount Sinai are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלכה למשה מסיני‎</span> “Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai.” There are several passages in the Bible from
which it appears that a certain unwritten law must have supplemented the written Law;
<i>e.g.</i>, when a man was found in the wilderness gathering sticks on the Sabbath-day, the
persons who discovered him brought him to Moses. They must have been taught before,
that the gathering of sticks constituted a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכה‎</span>, labour prohibited on the Sabbath-day, although this had not been distinctly stated
in the written Sabbath-laws. Had this not been the case the Sabbath-breaker could
not have been put to death, since he would have committed the sin in ignorance. The
same can be said of the man who cursed the name of God; he must have known that cursing
the name of God was a capital crime; for he would not have been put to death if the
Israelites had not yet been taught that death would be inflicted for such an act.
The question which the prophet Haggai (ii. 11) addressed to the priests, and the answers
which the priests gave, lead to the conclusion that the details of the laws on uncleanness
and cleanness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טומאה וטהרה‎</span>) must have been known to <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>the priests and the prophets to a greater extent than has been explained in the written
Law. Besides, there were many precepts that came at once into force. These must have
been fully explained to the people, who were anxious to obey the word of God.
</p>
<p>All these explanations and the detailed rules with regard to the written Divine precepts
of the Pentateuch, together with laws and institutions established in the course of
time by the highest authorities of the nation in obedience to the dictates of the
Pentateuch, form the contents of the Oral Law.
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.13.1">The Oral Law or the Tradition has been handed down in two different forms: (<i>a</i>) in the form of a running Commentary on the Pentateuch; such Commentaries were called
<i>Midrashim</i>; (<i>b</i>) arranged according to the different subjects, and treated independently of the text
of the Torah. This is done in the <i>Talmud</i> (“lesson,” “tradition”).
</p>
<p>The principal Midrashim are: <i>Mechilta</i> (lit. “measure”) on Exodus; <i>Sifra</i> (“book”) on Leviticus; <i>Sifre</i> (“books”) on Numbers and Deuteronomy. <i>Rabboth</i> on the Pentateuch and the five <i>Megilloth</i>. <i>Yalkut</i> (“collection”) on all the books of the Bible.
</p>
<p>The Talmud—which exists in two different recensions, viz., the Jerusalem Talmud and
the Babylonian Talmud—consists of two elements, which have to each other the relation
of text and commentary, and are called <i>Mishnah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משנה‎</span> “learnt by heart”), and <i>Gemara</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמרא‎</span> lit. “completion,” “a thing settled”); the former contains the traditional laws mostly
without argumentation; in the latter these laws are further discussed, examined, and
finally settled. Following the example <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>of the Pentateuch, the Talmud includes two elements: laws and narratives, or <i>Halachah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלכה‎</span>) and <i>Agada</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd32e5112" title="Source: אגדא">אגדה</span>‎</span>); the latter, the Agada, contains history, fables, allegory, meditations, prayers,
reflections, philosophical and religious discussions, and a large number of moral
sayings. The Midrashim likewise include these two elements.
</p>
<p>The Mishnah is divided into the following six <i>orders</i> or sections (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סדרים‎</span>):<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5124src" href="#xd32e5124">13</a>—
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="listNum">1.</span> ‎<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זרעים‎</span> “<i>Seeds.</i>” Laws referring to agriculture; preceded by laws on Divine Worship. </li>
<li><span class="listNum">2.</span> ‎<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מועד‎</span> “<i>Seasons.</i>” On Sabbath and Festivals. </li>

</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The laws taught in the Talmud are: (i) those which are directly or indirectly derived
from the text of the Pentateuch; they are called “laws derived from the Torah” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מן התורה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מדאורייתא‎</span>); (2) those which trace their origin to the time of Moses, or, in general, to the
remote past; they are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלכה למשה מסיני‎</span> “Law given to Moses on Sinai;” (3) those laws which originated between the period
of the Pentateuch and the close of the Bible; they are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברי קבלה‎</span> (“words of tradition”); (4) those which have been introduced in post-Biblical times;
they are laws <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מדרבנן‎</span> “laws introduced by our teachers.” These are either preventives against breaking
any of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>Divine precepts, and are then called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span id="xd32e5218"></span>‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סיג‎</span> “a fence,” or <i>tekanoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תקנות‎</span> “institutions” or “regulations”) made in order to ensure obedience to the Law and
improvement of conduct, to remove abuses and prevent error and misunderstanding; (5)
<i>Minhag</i>, “Custom” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנהג‎</span>); religious practices which have not been introduced by any authority or based on
a particular Biblical text, but in consequence of long usage have become as sacred
as a law established by the proper authority.
</p>
<p>These laws, as finally settled, were again codified, in various works, the most important
of which are the following two: (1) <i>Mishneh-torah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משנה תורה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יד החזקה‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5247src" href="#xd32e5247">14</a> lit. “Copy of the Law,” or “Strong Hand”), by Moses Maimonides (twelfth century)
in fourteen books; (2) <i>Shulchan-aruch</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלחן ערוך‎</span>, lit. “Table-arranged”), by Rabbi Joseph Caro (sixteenth century).
</p>
<p id="ch1.2.14"><i>Ninth Principle.</i>—“<i>I firmly believe that this Law will not be changed, and that there will not be any
other Law given by the Creator, blessed be His Name.</i>”
</p>
<p>In this article we pronounce our belief in the immutability of the Law. Over and over
again the phrase “an everlasting statute” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקת עולם‎</span>) occurs in the Pentateuch. It is true that the Hebrew term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם‎</span> is used in the Bible in the sense of “a very long time,” but in the phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקת עולם‎</span> the word cannot have that meaning. Some indication would have been necessary to inform
the people when the laws would cease to be in force. On the contrary, the test of
a prophet addressing his brethren in the name of God, as a <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>Divine messenger, consists in the harmony of his words with the precepts of the Pentateuch.
A prophet who, speaking in the name of God, abrogates any of the laws of the Pentateuch
is a false prophet. “If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet or a dreamer of
dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or wonder come to pass whereof
he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods which thou hast not known,
and let us serve them: thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or unto
that dreamer of dreams.… Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and
keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto
him. And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death; because he
hath spoken rebellion against the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land
of Egypt, … to draw thee aside out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee
to walk in” (Deut. xiii. 2–6). Moses distinctly says, “The things that are revealed
belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this
law” (<i>Ibid.</i> xxix. 28).
</p>
<p>There is also an express commandment given: “Ye shall not add unto the word which
I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments
of the Lord your God which I command you” (<i>Ibid.</i> iv. 2). In two ways this law may appear to have been disregarded: there are certain
sections of the Law which are at present not in force; and, on the other hand, there
are many apparently new precepts at present in force which have been introduced in
the course of time by the religious authorities <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>of the nation. But these are only apparent exceptions; in reality they are entirely
in harmony with the Pentateuch.
</p>
<p>As to the first class, there are many of the Divine commandments the fulfilment of
which depends on certain conditions; <i>e.g.</i>, the existence of the Tabernacle or of the Temple and its service, the possession
of Palestine by the Israelites, the independence of the Jewish State. In the absence
of these conditions such laws cannot be fulfilled. The laws of sacrifices belong to
this class. We are, in reference to these laws, in the same condition as a person
who is physically prevented from doing what he is commanded to do, and what he is
actually longing to do. The Law is not altered; our circumstances demand a <i>temporary</i> suspense of such laws and not their abrogation.
</p>
<p>The second class contains all those precepts which are known as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות דרבנן‎</span> “Rabbinical precepts,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תקנות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנהגים‎</span> “Institutions” and “Customs.” But these imply no addition to the Torah; they are
merely <span class="corr" id="xd32e5301" title="Source: bye-laws">byelaws</span> and regulations as regards the method of carrying out the laws of the Pentateuch,
and are designed to facilitate or ensure their fulfilment, and to prevent ourselves
from forgetting or disregarding them. Our teachers, the Rabbis, made it a matter of
conscience to describe their own regulations as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דרבנן‎</span> non-Pentateuchical, and throughout the Oral Law and the entire Talmudic literature
the distinction between <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דרבנן‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מן התורה‎</span> is noted and scrupulously upheld.
</p>
<p>It is useless to investigate whether it would be in harmony with the immutability
of the Divine Being to change the laws or any of them, or to grant a new <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>revelation. Certainly the words “I, the Lord, have not changed” (Mal. iii. 6) have
great weight; so also, “For God is not a son of man that he should change his mind”
(Num. xxiii. 19). But the fact that the laws were given by God as “an everlasting
statute for all generations” makes all philosophical speculation on that point superfluous.
Persons who address us in the name of God as His messengers, and bid us turn away
from any of the laws commanded in the Pentateuch, are in our eyes impostors, who,
knowingly or unknowingly, give forth their own opinions as Divine inspirations.

<p id="ch1.3.1" class="first">“Behold I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil: in that
I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep
his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply,
and that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou passest over Jordan
to go in to possess it” (Deut. xxx. 15). “I call heaven and earth to witness against
you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse:
therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed: to love the Lord
thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him: for that is thy life and the length
of thy days” (<i>Ibid.</i> xxx. 19, 20).
</p>
<p>The doctrine taught in this passage is the alpha and the omega of the sacred literature.
The whole history related in the Bible from the Creation to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>Babylonian captivity and the restoration of the Jews to their land is but one continuous
series of illustrations of this doctrine. Obedience to God’s word is followed by His
blessings, while disobedience is the cause of ruin and misery. Thus, in Lamentations
the poet exclaims in the name of his nation, “Just is the Lord, for I rebelled against
his commandment” (Lam. i. 18). Moses, in his last song exhorting the people to obedience
to the Almighty, begins his address with a praise of God’s justice, saying, “The Rock,
his work is perfect, for all his ways are judgment: a God of faithfulness, and without
wrong, just and right is he” (Deut. xxxii. 4). Even those who doubted the Divine justice,
in respect to the fate of individual persons or nations, admitted, “Surely I know
that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: but it shall
not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow:
because he feareth not before God” (Eccles. viii. 12, 13). Job, wondering why he should
be subjected to the greatest trials, cannot help confessing, “Even he will be to me
an help, for there shall not come before him an hypocrite” (Job xiii. 16). God is
therefore called “God of judgment,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהי המשפט‎</span> (Mal. ii. 17); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דין‎</span> “Judge” (1 Sam. xxiv. 15); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדיק‎</span> “just,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שופט צדיק‎</span> “just Judge” (Ps. vii. 12); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל קנא‎</span> “a jealous God” (Exod. xx. 5); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל נקמות‎</span> “God of vengeance” (Ps. xciv. 1); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים‎</span> “God” in the sense of “Judge.” The rejection of this belief by the wicked is expressed
by the phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין אלהים‎</span> “There is no God.” Thus David exclaims, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is
no God; they are corrupt; they <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>have done abominable things; there is none that doeth good” (Ps. xiv. 1). In post-Biblical
literature we find this unbelief, which is characterised as the source of all corruption
and wickedness, expressed by the phrase, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לית דין ולית דינא‎</span> “There is no judgment, and there is no judge” (Targ. Ps. Jonathan, Gen. iv. 8).
</p>
<p>There are two different sources from which such unbelief springs forth—limitation
of God’s powers and limitation of man’s capacities. The one of these sources leads
to a denial of God’s Omniscience, whilst the other deprives man of his freewill. There
are some who argue that God is too high to notice the ways and the acts of individual
men, and that these must be utterly insignificant in comparison with God’s greatness.
“They crush thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They slay the widow and
the stranger, and murder the fatherless. And they say, The Lord shall not see, neither
shall the God of Jacob consider” (Ps. xciv. 5–7). “And thou sayest, What doth God
know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? Thick clouds are a covering to him,
that he seeth not; and he walketh in the sphere of heaven” (Job xxii. 13, 14). The
very words which the Psalmist addresses to God with a heart full of gratitude, “What
is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him?” (Ps.
viii. 5), are uttered in a rebellious spirit by the unbeliever, who thus “sets limits
to the Holy One of Israel” (Ps. lxxviii. 41). But the power of God is not limited,
nor is His wisdom or His goodness; He is not only “the God of heaven,” but also “the
God of the earth.” He who has created everything has certainly a knowledge <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>of everything. “Lift up your eyes on high and see who hath created these things. He
who bringeth forth by number their host, calleth all of them by name; not one of them
escapeth the knowledge of him who is great in might and strong in power” (Isa. xl.
26). The Psalmist thus replies to those who deny God’s Omniscience: “Consider, ye
brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that planted the
ear, shall he not hear; he that formed the eye, shall he not see? He that chastiseth
the nations, shall he not correct, even he that teacheth man knowledge? The Lord knoweth
the thoughts of man, however vain they be” (Ps. xciv. 8–11). It would indeed be absurd
to imagine that the Creator of all things should not take notice of everything that
His hands have made. What difference can it make to the Almighty whether He provides
for the whole human race or for one individual man? It would be attributing to the
Divine Being human weakness and false pride if we assumed that He is too great to
take notice of any single creature of His! Rabbi Jochanan said wherever in the Bible
we find a description of the greatness of God, there we find His meekness. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, it is said in the Torah: “For the Lord, your God, he is the God of gods and the
Lord of lords, the mighty, the great, the strong, and the terrible, who regardeth
not persons, nor taketh reward. He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and
widow, and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment” (Deut. x. 17, 18).
</p>
<p>That man is not insignificant in the eyes of God is clearly expressed in the account
of the Creation, <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>where we are taught that man was made by God ruler “over the fish of the sea and over
the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth” (Gen. i. 26). “Man is loved by the Almighty,”
say our Sages, “because he is created in the image of God; but it was by a love still
greater that it was made known to him that he was created in the image of God” (Mishnah
Aboth, iii. 18).
</p>
<p>One of the chief blessings man received at the hands of his Creator is freewill. Within
certain limits man can determine his own actions. When he is about to do a thing,
he can reflect on it, examine its nature, investigate into its consequences, and accordingly
either do it or refrain from doing it. God said to the Israelites, “I call heaven
and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death,
the blessing and the curse; and thou shalt choose life” (Deut. xxx. 19). Our freedom,
however, is not unlimited. There are various causes that prevent us from remaining
firm to our will. If we resolve to do what is beyond our physical condition, we cannot
carry it out. Again, if a man chooses to do what would interfere with the will of
his fellow-men, he will frequently be compelled to abandon or change his own determination;
especially as he is in most cases ignorant of the thoughts and plans of his fellow-men.
In a still higher degree this is the case with regard to the designs of the Supreme
Being. Hence the great difference between our will and our actual deeds. We have,
however, the conviction that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בא לטהר מסייעין לו מן השמים בא לטמא פותחין לו‎</span> “He who wishes to purify <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>himself is helped by Heaven towards his aim, while he who desires to defile himself
will find the means thereto” (Babyl. Tal. Shabbath, p. 104).
</p>
<p>We admit that there are influences over which man has no control, and which, on the
contrary, help to shape his will. No man is so isolated as to be entirely inaccessible
to outward influences. Man inherits certain ideas and habits from his parents; others
are forced upon him by his surroundings, especially in his earliest youth; society
and the State compel him to conform to certain notions and laws; climate and temperature
also have no small share in the formation of man’s will. But in spite of all these
influences man’s will is free, and it is by reason of his free-will that he chooses
to conform to the rules of society and the laws of the State. Hence it happens that
individuals, subject to almost the same influences, still vary greatly in their resolutions.
What the one praises is an abhorrence to the other; what repels the one attracts the
other; what is recommended by the one is denounced by the other.
</p>
<p>Although there may be many who profess to believe in predestination or fate, as a
matter of fact all nations, ancient and modern, have based their constitutions on
the belief in man’s responsibility for his actions. Every State has its laws, its
system of reward and punishment. A principle so general and so essential for the safety
and welfare of society, as well as of each individual, cannot be a mere illusion;
its good effect has been tested and is generally recognised.
</p>
<p>In case of criminals and sinners, we make allowance for the possible outward influences
under which the offender may have fallen; we assume the broad principle, <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין אדם חוטא אלא אם כן נכנס בו רוח שטות‎</span> “No one sinneth unless the spirit of folly has entered into him” (Babyl. Talm. Sotah,
3<i>a</i>); but no one would go so far as to acquit the sinner altogether from blame. We pity
him and try to teach him how to return to the right path, and how to overcome outward
evil influences. When David had become aware of the greatness of his sin and sincerely
repented, he prayed, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then
will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall return unto thee” (Ps. li.
10–13). Both elements are here harmoniously united. God’s interference is asked for;
He helps man to carry out his good resolution; but man has free-will, and the author
of the psalm, in seeking the assistance of God, feels nevertheless the weight of his
own responsibility.
</p>
<p id="ch1.3.2"><i>Tenth Principle.</i>—“<i>I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be His name, knoweth all the actions of
men and all their thoughts, as it is said, ‘He that fashioneth the hearts of them
all, He that considereth all their works’</i> (Ps. xxxiii. 15).”
</p>
<p>In the rhymed form of the Creed (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יגדל‎</span>) this article is expressed thus: “He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts; He
beholdeth the end of a thing in its beginning.” Here the author proclaims not only
the Omniscience of God, but also His foresight; His knowledge is not limited, like
the knowledge of mortal beings, by space and time. The entire past and future lies
unrolled before His eyes, and nothing is hidden from <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>Him. Although we may form a faint idea of the knowledge of God by considering that
faculty of man that enables him, within a limited space of time, to look backward
and forward, and to unroll before him the past and the future, as if the events that
have happened and those that will come to pass were going on in the present moment,
yet the true nature of God’s knowledge no man can conceive. “God considereth all the
deeds of man,” without depriving him of his free-will; he may in this respect be compared
to a person who observes and notices the actions and the conduct of his fellow-men,
without interfering with them. It is the Will of God that man should have free-will
and should be responsible for his actions; and His foresight does not necessarily
include predetermination. In some cases the fate of nations or of individual men is
predetermined; we may even say that the ultimate fate or development of mankind is
part of the design of the Creation. But as the actual design in the Creation is concealed
from man’s searching eye, so is also the extent of the predetermination a mystery
to him. To solve this problem is beyond the intellectual powers of short-sighted mortals;
it is one of “the hidden things that belong to the Lord our God.”
</p>
<p>David, in Ps. cxxxix. 1–12, describes the Omniscience and the Omnipresence of God
in the following way: “O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my
down-sitting and mine up-rising; thou understandest my thoughts afar off. Thou searchest
out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not
a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge
is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither shall I go from
thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven,
thou art there; if I make my bed in the grave, behold, thou art there. If I take the
wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea: even there shall
thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness
shall cover me, and the light about me shall be night; even the darkness hideth not
from thee; but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike
to thee.”
</p>
<p>Our belief in God’s Omniscience is beautifully expressed in the Musaph prayer of New-year:
“Thou rememberest the work of bygone times, and thinkest of all the imaginations of
former days; all hidden things are revealed before thee; also all the multitude of
hidden things which are from the beginning. For there is no forgetting before the
throne of thy glory, and nothing is concealed from thine eye. Thou rememberest every
deed, and no thought is hidden from thee. Everything is revealed and known before
thee, O Lord our God, who beholdest and seest to the end of all generations.”
</p>
<p id="ch1.3.3"><i>Eleventh Principle.—“I firmly believe that the Creator, blessed be He, rewards those
who keep His commandments, and punishes those who transgress His commandments.”</i>
</p>
<p>The immediate reward and punishment for our conduct we receive in the pleasure and
happiness we experience in doing something good, and in the grief and <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>remorse we ought to feel on learning that we have displeased the Almighty by our conduct.
As a rule, every good act leads to further good acts, and every sin to further sins;
and our Sages say therefore: “The reward of a good act (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוה‎</span>) is another good act, and the punishment for a transgression is another transgression.”
</p>
<p>But when we speak of the principle of Retribution, we generally mean such reward and
punishment as is given in addition to the feeling of happiness or unhappiness inseparable
from our actions.
</p>
<p>This principle of retribution has been proclaimed in the grand Revelation made to
all Israel on Mount Sinai, in the Decalogue which has been accepted by all civilised
nations as the basis of religion: “I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation
of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
my commandments” (Exod. xx. 5, 6). We understand the doctrine of retribution only
in its general outlines; we are convinced of the truth of the Divine words, “There
is no peace to the wicked” (Isa. lvii. 21); but how the law is applied in every single
case is known to God alone. It is presumptuous on the part of short-sighted man to
criticise God’s judgments, and to find injustice in the seeming prosperity of the
wicked and the seeming misery of the righteous. What man is able to estimate the merits
of his neighbour fully and correctly? “For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man
looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Sam. xvi.
7). <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>This our inability of rightly estimating the merits of our neighbour’s actions, is
illustrated by the Biblical narrative of Cain and Abel. Both brought sacrifices to
the Lord; and we cannot discover any difference in their actions, and yet the sacrifice
of Cain was rejected by God and that of Abel was accepted. Some important element
there must therefore be in man’s deeds which is hidden from his neighbour’s eye, but
is known to the Almighty. The inability of man to penetrate into the secret of God’s
rule is also illustrated by the prophet Habakkuk. He asked, “Wherefore lookest thou
upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth
up the man that is more righteous than he; and makest men as the fishes of the sea,
as the creeping things that have no ruler over them?” Whereupon he receives the Divine
answer: “Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth
it.… Behold, there is crookedness in the eyes of him whose soul is not straight; but
the just will live by his faith” (Hab. i. 13, 14, and ii. 2, 4).
</p>
<p>One of the Psalmists (Asaph; Ps. lxxiii. 2 <i>seq.</i>) confesses that this problem had greatly troubled him and endangered his faith. He
says: “As for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I
was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are
no bands in their death; but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other
men; neither are they plagued like other men.… Therefore his people return hither:
and waters of a full cup are wrung out by them. And they say, How doth God know? and
is there knowledge <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>in the Most High? Behold, these are the wicked, and being <span class="corr" id="xd32e5432" title="Source: alway">always</span> at ease, they increase in riches. Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed
my hands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
morning. If I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I had dealt treacherously with
the generation of thy children. When I think how I might know this, it is trouble
in mine eyes: until I come into the sanctuary of God; then shall I consider their
latter end.” The temporary success and seeming prosperity of the wicked does not shake
the firm belief of the singer in the justice of God; his communion with God, his coming
into the sanctuaries of God, is a blessing which the soul of the pious yearns for,
and in comparison with which all the wealth and power of the wicked is but a deceitful
shadow.
</p>
<p>The Book of Job illustrates the vanity of man’s attempts to lift the veil that conceals
the plan of God’s decrees. The reader is informed beforehand why Job is afflicted
with pains and troubles. But Job and his friends have not been informed. Job desires
to know what act of his has brought upon him that terrible calamity, if it is to be
endured as a punishment; he protests his innocence, and criticises the justice of
the Almighty. The three friends declare with certainty that Job’s sufferings are a
punishment for sins committed, and are angry that Job does not accept their view.
</p>
<p>God appears, rebukes Job for his presumption, but declares that the view expressed
by his friends, insinuating sinful conduct to Job, was wrong, and that Job, <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>who contended that he did not know the cause of the suffering, spoke more rightly
than his friends. For Job had not been afflicted because of his sins, and this was
shown to the friends of Job by the compensation which God gave Job for all that he
had lost and suffered.
</p>
<p>Koheleth likewise shows the futility of man’s endeavour to find independently of Divine
revelation the aim and object of man’s life on earth, or the share his free-will has
in the performance of his actions and the determination of his fate. Man is lost in
a labyrinth of problems, out of which he can extricate himself only by faith in God
and His guidance. The result to which the investigations of Koheleth led him is expressed
thus: “Fear God, keep his commandments; for this is the whole of man’s duty. For every
action God will bring to judgment together with all hidden thoughts, whether good
or evil” (Eccles. xii. 13).
</p>
<p>The acts of Divine justice recorded in the sacred literature serve as a warning to
the evil and an encouragement to the good. They are all of a material character, as
only in this shape can they be perceived by man. But by no means do they exhaust all
the ways of God. The Divine retribution so frequently referred to in the Law points
mostly to the good or evil consequences which the conduct of the Israelites will bring
upon the whole community or state, because the whole community is benefited by the
virtues and injured by the misconduct of each of the members composing it; it is the
duty of the authorities, by watchfulness and by well-defined punishments, to prevent
the spread of disobedience to the Divine Law. What other rewards or punishments await
the individual <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>in this life or after death we do not know. But there are, especially in the Psalms,
numerous indications that the pious sufferer was sure that everlasting happiness would
more than compensate for the absence of material and transient success in this life.
The following passages may serve as an illustration:—
</p>
<p>“Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall
compass him about” (Ps. xxxii. 10).
</p>
<p>“How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under
the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee
is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light” (xxxvi. 8–10).
</p>
<p>“For evil-doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit
the land” (xxxvii. 9).
</p>
<p>“For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for
ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off” (<i>Ibid.</i> 28).
</p>
<p>“Mark the perfect man; and behold the upright: for the latter end of that man is peace.
As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; the latter end of the wicked
shall be cut off” (<i>Ibid.</i> 37, 38).
</p>
<p>In these and similar passages the pious and enthusiastic singer has in his mind something
more durable and permanent than this short life, or otherwise the conflict between
his hopes and the reality would have shaken his faith.
</p>
<p id="ch1.3.4"><i>Twelfth Principle.—“I firmly believe in the coming of <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>Messiah; and although he may tarry, I daily hope for his coming.”</i>
</p>
<p>When Abraham was chosen by God to be the founder of a nation proclaiming the Unity
of God, when he was commanded to separate from his relatives and friends and to travel
a stranger in a foreign land, the blessing promised to him was not to be enjoyed by
him in the present, but by his descendants in remote future: “All the families of
the earth shall be blessed in thee” (Gen. xii. 3). The same promise was repeated when
Abraham stood the trial, and was ready to bring any sacrifice in obedience to the
Will of the Supreme Being: “All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves in
thee” (<i>Ibid.</i> xxii. 18). The conviction that the seed of Abraham have the distinction and the mission
to become a source of a blessing to all mankind was transmitted from generation to
generation; from Abraham through Isaac to Jacob or Israel, whose descendants, the
Israelites, guarded the inherited charge, as their peculiar treasure. Before receiving
the Decalogue on Mount Sinai, the Israelites were reminded of this their mission in
the words, “And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exod.
xix. 6). It was not by force of arms or by persuasion that they were to influence
the whole earth, but by setting an example of noble, pure, and holy conduct. A special
spot was selected for them where they should, in seclusion from the rest of the world,
be trained in the true worship of God and in the practice of virtue. Zion and Jerusalem
became in course of time the religious centre from which “instruction came forth and
the word of the Lord.” The Israelites became <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>negligent in their mission and faithless to their holy charge. Instead of leading
other nations to the true worship of God, they allowed themselves to be misled by
them to idolatry; instead of living a pure life of justice and righteousness, they
yielded to luxury and lust, and committed acts of injustice and oppression. They were
punished. Troubles followed troubles; they lost their independence and their religious
centre. The men of God, the prophets, from Moses to the last of the prophets, Malachi,
foretold the catastrophe, but at the same time added words of comfort and encouragement,
pointing to a distant future, when “her appointed time of trouble will be complete,
and her guilt atoned for;” when Israel will be restored to his land, and under the
guidance of Messiah, “the Anointed of the Lord,” he will be filled with the fear of
the Lord and an earnest desire to do that which is just and right. Moses, in one of
his last addresses to Israel, said, “And it shall come to pass, when all these things
have come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which 1 have set before thee; and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven
thee, and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice, according
to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart,
and with all thy soul; that the Lord thy God will return thy captivity, and have compassion
on thee, and will return, and gather thee from all the peoples whither the Lord thy
God hath scattered thee. If any of thy outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven,
from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee,”
&amp;c. (Deut. xxx. 1–3). <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>The glorious times of Messiah are described by Isaiah in the following words: “And
it shall come to pass in the end of days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall
be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills,
and all nations shall flow unto it. And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he
will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths, for out of Zion shall go
forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the
nations, and shall reprove many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more” (Isa. ii. 2–4). The same has been prophesied
in almost identical words by Micah (iv. 1–4), a contemporary of Isaiah. The peace
of the Messianic period is figuratively described by Isaiah in the following verses:
“And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall
lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed: their young ones shall lie down together,
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the
hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk’s den. They
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of
the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Isa. xi. 6–9). In the days
of Messiah all people will unite in the proclamation of the Unity of God and in <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>His worship: “And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall the
Lord be one, and his name one” (Zech. xiv. 9). “Then will I turn to the peoples a
pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with
one consent” (Zeph. iii. 9).
</p>
<p>The distinction given to Israel and to his land will again appear in all its glory.
Israel is punished, deprived of independence, even despised and ill-treated at times;
but with all this he is loved by God, and not rejected by Him for ever. Isaiah prophesies
as follows: “Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel, for thou art my servant: I
have formed thee; thou art my servant; O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me”
(Isa. xliv. 21). “For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed,
saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee” (<i>Ibid.</i> liv. 10). Comp. lix. 20, 21; lx. 19–21; lxvi. 22; Jer. xxxiii. 25, 26; Hos. ii. 21,
22.
</p>
<p>Those who during the years of Israel’s punishment have despised and ill-treated him
will repent of their conduct when they witness his wonderful redemption. Their repentance
is beautifully depicted by Isaiah in the passage beginning, “Behold, my servant will
be successful” (lii. 13). Israel, the servant of God, patiently bears insults and
persecution, faithfully waiting for the fulfilment of the Divine promise. Israel’s
oppressors will then, on seeing how God loves him, confess their wrong and own that
Israel has innocently suffered at their hands. With the redemption of Israel <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>is connected the restoration of the throne of David. “A branch of the house of David”
will be at the head of the nation, upon whom “the spirit of the Lord will rest, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord” (Isa. xi. 2). Thus Jeremiah prophesies: “Behold,
the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and
he shall reign as king, and deal wisely, and shall execute judgment and justice in
the land. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this
is his name, whereby he shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness” (xxiii. 5,
6). All the attributes of Messiah are those of a human being in his highest possible
perfection. No superhuman qualities are ascribed to him; all his glory, all his success,
is dependent on the Will of God. He is an ideal man, and an ideal king, but not more;
if miracles are to be wrought, it is not Messiah who will perform them, but God, who
will act wondrously for Messiah and Israel. The advent of Messiah is not expected
to change the nature of man, much less the course of the world around us. The only
change we expect is, that the Unity of God will be acknowledged universally, and that
justice and righteousness will flourish over all the earth. Those who believe in a
superhuman nature of Messiah are guilty of idolatry. Our Sages express this principle
in the words, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין בין העולם הזה לימות המשיח אלא שעבוד מלכיות בלבד‎</span>, “There is no other difference between the present time and the days of Messiah but
the restoration of Israel’s independence.”
</p>
<p>An opinion is mentioned in the Talmud in the name <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>of a Rabbi Hillel—not the great Hillel, the Babylonian—that “there is no Messiah for
the Israelites, because they have already enjoyed the blessings of Messiah in the
reign of Hezekiah” (Babyl. Talm. Sanhedrin, 98<i>b</i>). This can only refer to the miraculous defeat of the enemy, and the direct benefits
derived therefrom by the Israelites. But the Rabbi by no means rejects our belief
that Messiah will come, and with him the universal worship of the One God, the universal
practice of virtue in all its forms, and universal peace and prosperity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5491src" href="#xd32e5491">15</a> Hillel, however, found no support for his view; on the contrary, his error is at
once shown to him, that he forgot the prophets who prophesied after Hezekiah.
</p>
<p>There are some theologians who assume the Messianic period to be the most perfect
state of civilisation, but do not believe in the restoration of the kingdom of David,
the rebuilding of the Temple, or the repossession of Palestine by the Jews. They altogether
reject the national hope of the Jews. These theologians either misinterpret or wholly
ignore the teaching of the Bible, and the Divine promises made through the men of
God.
</p>
<p>The hopes with which our religion inspires us can never lead us to intrigues, political
combinations, insurrection, or warfare for the purpose of regaining Palestine and
appointing a Jewish Government. On the contrary, our religion teaches us to seek the
welfare of those nations in whose midst we live, and to conscientiously <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>take part in the work for their national progress and prosperity, whilst patiently
waiting for the miraculous fulfilment of the prophecies. Even if a band of adventurers
were to succeed in reconquering Palestine for the Jews by means of arms, or reacquiring
the Holy Land by purchasing it from the present owners, we should not see in such
an event the consummation of our hopes.
</p>
<p>Does the advent of Messiah and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem imply the
restoration of the Sacrificial Service? The last of the prophets, Malachi, declares
that “then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant unto the Lord, as
in the days of old, and as in ancient years” (Mal. iii. 4). In the same spirit all
the prophets spoke, and when in some cases prophets denounce sacrifices, it is only
the sacrifices of the wicked that they denounce. Sacrifices must be preceded by purification
of the heart, and by the earnest resolve to obey the word of God, otherwise they constitute
an increase of sin. When we express our longing for the rebuilding of the Temple and
the restoration of the Temple-Service—the return of the priests to their service,
and the Levites to their song and music—it is solely our desire for the opportunity
of serving God according to His Will and command, and is not a feeling that should
be modified by fashion or taste. It is because of our sins that we have been deprived
of our Temple; the rebuilding of the Temple and the restoration of the Sacrificial
Service will be the result of our own purification, and the consequent Divine pardon.
</p>
<p>When will this take place? We do not know, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>are content to bear in mind that the time of our redemption is one of the “hidden
things which are the Lord our God’s;” “If it tarries,” says Habakkuk, “wait for it,
for it will surely come, and not later than the time fixed” (ii. 3). Certain numbers
of days and weeks are mentioned in Daniel,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5508src" href="#xd32e5508">16</a> but it is not stated how these are to be counted; to which period they are intended
to apply; whether to the time of the restoration under Zerubbabel, to the period of
the Maccabees, to the destruction of the second Temple, or to the future and final
redemption. It is also possible that these numbers have some symbolic signification.
In reference to these mysterious numbers Daniel says (xii. 8–10): “And I heard, but
I understood not; then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time
of the end. Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white, and be refined;
but the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand; but they
that be wise shall understand.” These words of Daniel are a warning to all those who
are inclined to compute by means of the numbers given in Daniel the exact year of
Messiah. Many have disregarded the warning and have fallen into gross error. It is
the duty of the pious Israelite to have faith in God’s wisdom, goodness, and power:
“The righteous shall live in his faith” (Hab. ii. 4).
</p>
<p id="ch1.3.5"><i>Thirteenth Principle.—“I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the
dead at a time which <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>will please the Creator, blessed be His name and exalted His memorial for ever and
ever.”</i>
</p>
<p>As imperfect as is our conception of a creation from nothing, so imperfect is our
notion of the resurrection of the dead. We only perceive the dissolution of the body
into its elements, which enter into new combinations and form new bodies; and it is
almost impossible for us to imagine a reconstruction of the original body out of its
own elements. There is no doubt that the Almighty produces fresh life from death—we
need only observe the action of Nature in the world around us to convince ourselves
that God is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מחיה המתים‎</span> “that he gives life to things dead.” But how this will be done in reference to our
own selves, whether we shall enjoy the same life, whether our future life will be
an improved edition of the present one, whether <i>all</i> will be restored to life, or whether the new life after death will be enjoyed by
the soul alone, or by body and soul jointly: these and similar questions transcend
the bounds of human knowledge. We know nothing but the bare fact that God can restore
to life that which is dead, and that a resurrection will take place. But all further
description of this event rests on man’s imaginative powers. The fact itself is stated
by Daniel (xii. 2): “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt;” it is indicated
in the Pentateuch in the words, “I shall kill and I shall make alive; I have wounded
and I shall heal” (Deut. xxxii. 39). According to Maimonides, the author of the Thirteen
Principles, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is identical with that of
the immortality <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>of the soul, calling the life of the soul after separation from the body, resurrection;
the verse quoted from Daniel is accordingly interpreted in a figurative sense. The
belief in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תחית המתים‎</span> “the resurrection of the dead,” emphatically enjoined in the Talmud, was thus restricted
by Maimonides to the separate life of man’s soul after his death, because the immortality
of the soul appeared to him more rational and more acceptable to thinking man. This
may be the case, but we, human beings, a combination of soul and body, are, in reality,
as unable to conceive the separate existence of our soul as we are to comprehend the
resurrection of our body. We are taught that there exists for us a life beyond the
present one. But any attempt to describe that life must be considered merely as an
act of imagination rather than of knowledge. It is probably for this reason that no
distinct ordinance in the Pentateuch sanctioned the belief in future life, or in the
immortality of the soul. The belief, nevertheless, existed among the Israelites, and
found expression in several passages of the Bible. Foremost among these is the following
verse of Koheleth (xii. 7): “And the dust shall return to the earth as it was, and
the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” David also gives frequent expression
to this belief in his Psalms. In the Seventeenth Psalm, <i>e.g.</i>, he speaks with contempt of the wealth and the success of the wicked, and says of
himself: “As for me, I shall see thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied,
when I awake, with beholding thy likeness” (Ps. xvii. 15). Similarly he says in Ps.
xvi. 8–11: “I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth: my
flesh also shall dwell in safety. For thou wilt not leave my soul to death, neither
wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life;
in thy presence is fulness of joy, in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”
In the Book of Proverbs (xii. 28) we read: “In the path of righteousness there is
life, and a smoothed way where there is no death.” These and similar verses show that
the belief in the immortality of the soul was firmly established among the Israelites,
and found frequent expression in the words of the men of God.
</p>
<p>The belief in the Resurrection assists us in our endeavour of reconciling the apparent
contradictions between the justice of God and our own experience. The latter comprises
only the transient pleasures of the wicked and the sufferings of the just in this
short life, and cannot be compared with the pleasure of the good and the suffering
of the bad in the future, eternal life. Another benefit derived from this belief consists
in its raising us above the ordinary sphere of earthly gains and losses; it turns
our minds to higher aims; it purifies our heart and elevates it.
</p>
<p>Opponents of this belief quote some passages from Job in support of their view; <i>e.g.</i>: “Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the
shadow of death” (x. 21). “As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he that
goeth down to the grave shall come up no more” (vii. 9). These and similar words were
uttered by Job when he suffered great pain, and wished, as many would <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>wish under similar circumstances, to be relieved by death from his momentary troubles,
unconcerned as to what might happen in distant future. Besides, Job is not an Israelite;
he is described as a man just and upright, but need not have had the same convictions
and beliefs as the Israelites. How little the above verses represent the exact view
of Job may be learnt from the fact that he gives also expression to the opposite belief:
“If a man dieth, will he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
till my relief cometh” (xiv. 14). “And when my skin is gone, when worms have destroyed
this body, and when my flesh is no more, yet shall I see God” (xix. 26).

</p>
<p><i>The Number of the Principles of our Creed.</i>—The contents of our Creed has its source in the Bible; there the Principles are taught,
some directly, others indirectly; but they are neither formulated nor enumerated.
The most ancient declaration of faith is contained in the verse: “Hear, O Israel,
the Lord is our God; the Lord is One” (Deut. vi. 4). There is even a tradition (Midrash
Rabboth Gen. ch. xcviii.) that these words were first uttered by the sons of Jacob,
when their father, in the last hour of his life, wished to know whether all his children
were faithful to the inherited religion. We repeat these words <span class="corr" id="xd32e5551" title="Corrected by author from: twice">thrice</span> a day, in the morning and in the evening; with these words on their lips the martyrs
of our nation suffered death; these words are the last which the pious Israelite utters
before “his spirit returneth to him who hath given it.” When the Israelites took possession
of Palestine, at the solemn assembly between the mountains of Gerizim and Ebal, they
were not commanded to recite or sign a series of articles of faith, but to declare
their determination to obey the Will of God as expressed in the Torah. This was also
done by our forefathers when standing round Sinai. They declared, “All that the Lord
hath said, will we do and hear” (Exod. xxiv. 7). When Elijah on Mount Carmel had demonstrated
the perverseness of the Baal-worship, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>Israelites declared, “The Lord, he is God.” Jonah describes himself thus: “I am a
Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of the heavens, who hath made the sea and the
dry land” (Jonah i. 9).—Also, after the Restoration in the days of Zerubbabel, Ezra,
and Nehemiah, the Jews were exhorted to act according to the words of the Torah, and
they renewed their covenant with God in this respect, but nothing is known of a declaration
of belief, of reciting or signing articles of faith.—The struggle with the Samaritans
produced special legislation with regard to certain religious observances, but there
was no need for the formulation of a creed. But care has been taken that the principles
of our faith should find expression in our daily prayers. Thus the sections which
precede and follow the <i>Shema</i> contain an indirect declaration of the three fundamental principles of our religion,
the Existence of the Creator, Revelation, and Divine Justice. The first section, called
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת יוצר‎</span> praises God as the sole source of everything, of light and darkness, of good and
evil. In the second section (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת אהבה‎</span>) we acknowledge in gratitude the benefits of Revelation; and in the third (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת גאולה‎</span>) we thank God for the redemption of our forefathers from Egypt, by inflicting punishment
on our oppressors. Although much stress is laid on faith (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמונה‎</span>), and he who was found wanting in faith was stigmatised as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כופר‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כופר בעיקר‎</span> unbeliever or infidel, yet no creed was officially formulated. Even the discussions
between the Sadducees and Pharisees, which concerned also the principles of faith,
brought only about certain changes in the prayer—such as the substitution of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מן העולם ועד העולם‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עד עילם‎</span> in the responses of the congregation during the public service, in order to establish
the belief in the existence of another world and another life beyond the grave.
</p>
<p>The necessity of formulating the principles of faith arose when the contact and intercourse
with other religious communities <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>gave frequent occasion to discussions on these and similar subjects. Without some
fixed basis, it was feared, disorder and confusion would disturb the peace in the
camp of Israel.
</p>
<p>Thus Saadiah says in <i>Emunoth Ve-deoth</i>: “I have seen men drowned, as it were, in the sea of doubts, covered by the waves
of error, and there was no diver to bring them up from the depth, nor any swimmer
to take hold of them and draw them out. As I possessed enough of what God taught me
to support them, and had the power for upholding them granted to me, I considered
it my duty to assist and guide my fellow-men according to the best of my abilities.”
In ten chapters Saadiah discusses the various theological problems, and defends the
following articles of faith: Existence of God; His Unity; Revelation; Free-will; Immortality
of the Soul; Resurrection of the Dead; Final Redemption of Israel; Reward and Punishment.
Although these principles do not seem to have been shaped into the form of a solemn
declaration or embodied in the prayer, they are treated as themes familiar to the
reader, and as elements essential in the Jewish faith (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשר אנחנו מחויבים להאמין‎</span>).
</p>
<p>Rabbi Abraham ben David (Rabad, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רא״בד‎</span>), in his <i>Haemunah haramah</i> (“The Lofty Faith”), seems to assume three principles: Existence of God, Prophecy,
and Reward and Punishment, which to defend from the attacks of the unbeliever, he
considers as the first duty of the Jewish scholar (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏התורני‎</span>); but he does not follow this decision in his book. He comprises all religious truths
which he has to demonstrate under six heads (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיקרים‎</span>). The first of them he calls “Root of the faith;” it expresses the conviction that
all things in the universe owe their existence to a “First Cause”—God. Next comes
“Unity of God,” which is followed by “Attributes of God,” “The intermediate causes
of natural changes.” “Prophecy”—or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האמונה האחרונה‎</span>, “the <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>subsequent belief,” <i>i.e.</i>, the belief which follows the belief in God—and “Divine Providence.”
</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi explains to the Kuzarite king his faith as follows: “We believe
in the God of our forefathers, who brought the Israelites forth from Egypt by signs
and miracles, sustained them in the wilderness with manna, divided for them the sea
and Jordan, gave them the Law through Moses, exhorted them through His prophets to
obey His commandments: in short, we believe all that is written in the Torah” (Kuzari,
i. 8). He then explains philosophically “the root of the faith” in the following ten
propositions: (1) The universe is finite; (2) it had a beginning; (3) the time of
the beginning had to be determined by the Divine Being; (4) God is without a beginning;
(5) God is eternal (<i>i.e.</i>, without an end); (6) incorporeal; (7) omniscient; (8) all-wise, all-powerful, living;
(9) free in His actions; (10) without change. To these must be added the belief in
prophecy, in the truth of the prophecies, and in man’s free-will, which he fully discusses
in the course of the book.
</p>
<p>Rabbenu Bachya, in his “Duties of the Hearts” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חובות הלבבות‎</span>), considers also faith as one of these duties, and expresses it in the most simple
form, “Belief in God and in His Law.” He does not, however, devote a special chapter
to faith. The first chapter treats of the distinctively Jewish creed of God’s Unity,
but less as a duty of belief than as a duty of research and study for the purpose
of philosophically establishing that God is One. The author states only briefly in
the prefatory notes to the first chapter, that it is our duty to believe in the Existence,
Providence, and Unity of God, as commanded in the verse, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord
is our God, the Lord is One.”
</p>
<p>Maimonides comprehended our belief in thirteen articles, known as the Thirteen Principles
of our Creed. He insists <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>on the fact that these articles are not the product of chance; they are the result
of long study and deep research. Every one of them is essential, and he who rejects
any of them is an infidel (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כופר‎</span>), and puts himself by such rejection outside the Jewish community (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוצא מכלל ישראל‎</span>).
</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph Albo criticised Maimonides’ thirteen articles of faith (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיקרים‎</span>). Whilst recognising all of them as true, he would make a difference between fundamental
principles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיקרים‎</span>) and secondary beliefs (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שרשים‎</span>). The former are all those dogmas by which Judaism falls and stands, without which
Jewish faith cannot be imagined; the latter are those principles which are actually
true, but Judaism can be conceived without them. To the former he counts, <i>e.g.</i>, the belief in the existence of God, to the latter the belief that to Him alone prayer
is to be offered. For Judaism cannot be conceived without the belief in God’s existence,
but could be conceived without the belief that only God is to be prayed to. Albo further
finds fault with Maimonides for not having embodied in the Creed the belief in man’s
free-will, in the truth of the Biblical account of the miracles, in the <i lang="la">Creatio ex nihilo</i>, and the like. To these objections Maimonides would reply, that the articles enumerated
by him were all actually fundamental, the question whether Judaism could be imagined
without this or that principle being of no importance whatever; and that the dogmas
named by Albo as omitted, were implied in the Thirteen Principles. According to Albo
there are three fundamental principles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיקרים‎</span>): Existence of God, Revelation, and Reward and Punishment. The first includes four
articles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שרשים‎</span>): Unity of God, His Incorporeality, Eternity, and Perfection; the second implies
three: God’s Omniscience, Divine inspiration, and Divine messengers (prophets); the
third only one: Providence. Albo’s criticisms on Maimonides have passed away without
effect. The Principles <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>of Faith as formulated by Maimonides have found their way into the daily Prayer-book
in prose and poetry, and have since formed an essential element in every text-book
of Jewish religion. Modern theologians erroneously quote Albo in favour of rejecting
some of the articles, because he speaks of three fundamental principles; but they
forget that Albo never rejects any of the thirteen principles; he only insists on
making a difference between those which are more and those which are less fundamental.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.1"><i>On the First Principle</i>, pp. 22 <i>sqq.</i>
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.1.1">Maimonides does not mention the term Creator except in the beginning of each paragraph
as a substitute for “God.” He employs the philosophical term “First Cause” in defining
the existence of God. In the sixty-ninth chapter of the first book of “The Guide”
we find the explanation thereof. He says: “The philosophers, as you know, call God
the First Cause (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עִלָּה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סִבָּה‎</span>); but those who are known by the name Mutakallemim (Mohammedan theologians) are very
much opposed to the use of that name, and prefer to call Him ‘Maker’ (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פּוֹעֵל‎</span>), believing that there is a great difference whether we use the one term or the other.
They argue thus: Those who say that God is the Cause, implicitly assume the coexistence
of the Cause with that which was produced by that Cause, and believe that the universe
is eternal, and that it is inseparable from God. Those, however, who say that God
is the Maker do not assume the coexistence of the maker with his work; for the maker
can exist anterior to his work; we cannot even imagine how a maker can be in action
unless he existed before his own work. This is an argument advanced by persons who
do not distinguish between the potential and the actual. For there is no difference
whether we say ‘cause’ or ‘maker;’ ‘cause’ as a mere <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>potentiality precedes its effect; and ‘cause’ as actuality coexists with its effect.
The same is the case with ‘maker;’ so long as the work is not done, he is a maker
potentially, and exists before his work; he is an actual maker when the work is done,
and then he coexists with his work.”
</p>
<p>“The reason why the philosophers called God ‘the Cause’ and did not call Him ‘the
Maker’ is not to be sought in their belief that the universe is eternal, but in other
principles, which I will briefly explain to you. Everything owes its origin to the
following four causes: the substance, the form, the <i lang="la">agens</i>, the final cause. The philosophers believe—and I do not differ from them—that God
is the <i lang="la">agens</i>, the form, and the final cause of everything; in order to express this, they call
God ‘the Cause’ of all things. Every one of these three causes leads, through a chain
of causes, to God as the First Cause.” Maimonides further points out in this chapter
that the choice of the term by no means decides the question whether the universe
has had a beginning or not.
</p>
<p>Maimonides has been severely criticised by his successors for the absence of the belief
in “Creation from nothing” from the Creed. In “The Guide” Maimonides distinctly states
that the arguments for “Creation from nothing” and the arguments against it are equi-balanced,
and that for this reason he follows the literal interpretation of the Scripture as
regards Creation. Were the arguments in favour of the eternity of the universe stronger,
he would not have found any difficulty in interpreting Scripture accordingly. Such
being the view of our great philosopher, he could not make the belief in Creation
part of the Creed, or declare that all who denied the Creation from nothing were unbelievers.
</p>
<p>However strange this argumentation of Maimonides may appear, and however arbitrary
his treatment of Scriptural teaching, his view is not without justification. It seems
<span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>strange that, in spite of all his reverence for the Bible, he should have entrusted
himself entirely to the guidance of his own reason, and forced, as it were, the Bible
by peculiar interpretations to follow his reasoning. In truth, however, the method
of Maimonides is neither strange nor arbitrary. There is no doubt that figurative
language is extensively used in the Scriptures, especially in the poetical and the
prophetical books. Whether a certain expression or phrase was to be understood in
its literal meaning or in a figurative sense must be learnt from the context; in some
cases—as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the exhortation, “Ye shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart” (Deut. x. 16)—the
figurative sense is accepted by all, whilst in other cases opinions are divided. Our
decision in favour of the one interpretation or the other is based on our conviction
that the Bible contains nothing but truth. When we discover a contradiction between
a Biblical statement and the dictates of our reason, we are sure that we have erred
either in the right understanding of the words of the Bible or in our reasoning. On
finding the mistake in our reasoning we abandon what we have hitherto considered as
fully established; but so long as we are unable to discover where our reasoning is
faulty, we either suspend our judgment for the present and consider the question as
one of the problems which we have not yet been able to solve satisfactorily, or, whenever
possible, we attempt to reconcile by figurative interpretation the teaching of the
Bible with the results of our research. Maimonides is therefore justified in saying
that so long as reason does not decide against the teaching of the Bible in its literal
sense he would adhere to the latter, and only if reason were to decide against the
<i lang="la">Creatio ex nihilo</i>, he would follow reason and interpret Scripture accordingly.
</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that Maimonides travelled here on rather slippery ground, and
set a dangerous example when <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>he admitted that he would interpret Scripture according to his preconceived view of
the world’s beginning. But, on the other hand, it must be owned that many passages
of the Bible admit of a figurative interpretation, and the reader must follow his
own reason and discretion in deciding in each particular case which of the two interpretations
is the correct one. Maimonides has not made excessive use of this license.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.1.2">Saadiah in his <i>Emunoth Ve-deoth</i> devotes the first chapter to the problem of the Creation. It is headed <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חדוש‎</span> “Creation,” and examines thirteen different opinions as to the origin of the universe.
In the conclusion of this chapter he makes the following remarks: “Perhaps some one
might ask in what manner something was produced from nothing. To this we reply as
follows: If we were able to understand this, we should not have ascribed the creative
act to God alone. But we declare God as the only Creator, because we can form no idea
as to the manner in which something is created from nothing. Those who desire us to
show them how to do this, desire, in fact, that we should make them and ourselves
creators. We only conceive in our mind the fact of the Creation, but cannot form an
idea or image of the process itself.… There may be some who think little of the universe,
and wonder that this should be the result of all the power and wisdom of God. We reply
that He created as much as, according to His knowledge, would be within the range
of man’s observation and perception, and would be sufficient to teach man the existence
of God.… How can we conceive the idea that the universe counts only 4633 years? But
the universe has been created, as we believe, and must have had a beginning at a certain
time. Suppose we had been living in the year 100; we should then not have been surprised:
why should we be surprised now?” The question as to the purpose for which the universe
<span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>was created, Saadiah makes three attempts to answer. Maimonides, however, in “The
Guide,” more correctly, shows that the question is unanswerable and superfluous. For,
whatever purpose we assume, we must always further inquire what is the purpose of
this purpose, and so on <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, till we arrive at the answer, it was the Will of God. If the prophet declares that
God “hath not created it in vain, but hath formed it for dwelling,” he likewise says
implicitly it was the <i>Will of God</i> that the earth should be for a dwelling.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.1.3">The question, however, arises whether the Biblical account of the Creation harmonises
in all its parts with the results of scientific research. To prove the existence of
harmony between the two discordant elements has been since days of old the task which
theologians proposed to themselves; philosophic culture forced them to accept the
doctrines of a certain school of thought as established truths, whilst religious feeling
would not allow them to abandon the teaching of the inspired writers. But the search
after this harmony was superfluous, and the harmony found was illusory. For, whilst
the teaching of the Bible remains unchanged, the systems of philosophy and science,
like everything human, have no claim to permanency; each system has its season; it
begins to shine, and rises higher and higher; and when it has reached the zenith,
it begins steadily to decline till it disappears beneath the horizon of science. So
long as Aristotle and Ptolemy were dominant, theologians exerted themselves to show
that the account contained in the first chapter of Genesis fully harmonises with Aristotle
and Ptolemy. When these princes were dethroned, and their places were occupied by
others, the old harmony was gone, and a new method had to be invented. Maimonides
has clearly pointed out how the conflict between reason and faith, where it existed,
could best be brought to a conclusion. <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>Such of the laws of nature as have been established by human acumen and human observation
have been discovered in the phenomena of existing nature; but the phenomenon of creation
has never been observed in nature from which we could learn the laws of creation.
</p>
<p>In the seventeenth chapter of the Second Book of “The Guide” Maimonides says as follows:
“Everything produced comes into existence from non-existence; even when the substance
of a thing has been in existence, and has only changed its form, the thing itself
which has gone through the process of genesis and development, after having arrived
at its final state, has properties different from those which it possessed at the
commencement of the transition from potentiality to reality or before that time.…
It is quite impossible to infer from the qualities which a thing possesses after having
passed through all the stages of its development what its condition was at the moment
when this process commenced; nor does the condition of a thing at that moment show
what its previous condition had been. If you make this mistake, and attempt to prove
the nature of a thing in potential existence by its properties when actually existing,
you will fall into great confusion; you will reject evident truth and admit false
opinions.… If philosophers would consider this well, and reflect on it, they would
find that it represents exactly the dispute between Aristotle and ourselves. We, the
followers of Moses, our teacher, and of Abraham, our father, believe that the universe
has been produced from nothing, and has developed in a certain manner, and that it
has been created in a certain order. The Aristotelians oppose us, and found their
objections on the properties which the things in the universe possess when in actual
existence and fully developed. We admit the existence of these properties, but hold
that these properties themselves have come into existence from absolute non-existence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>The arguments of our opponents are thus refuted; they have demonstrative force only
against those who hold that the nature of things as at present in existence proves
the Creation. But this is not my opinion.”
</p>
<p>This reasoning holds good with regard to the modern theory of Evolution. We may be
able to discover numerous facts in evidence of this theory, we may well conceive the
idea of a protoplasm developing into a whole system of worlds, and yet our belief
in the truth of the Biblical account of the Creation is not shaken in the least. The
laws of Evolution are <i>the result</i> of the creative act of the Almighty, and not its <i>causes</i>; they include nothing that could disprove the correctness of the theory of <i lang="la">Creatio ex nihilo</i>.
</p>
<p>Rabbi S.&nbsp;R. Hirsch, in his “Commentary on Genesis” (i.) says: “The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span> ‘in the beginning,’ teaches that nothing preceded the act of Creation; that there
was a <i lang="la">Creatio ex nihilo</i>. This truth forms the foundation of the faith which the Divine Law is intended to
establish in our hearts. The opposite theory is the doctrine of the eternity of the
substance, a theory which leaves to the Creator nothing but the function of giving
form to the substance that has existed already from eternity, and which has been the
basis of the heathen belief up to the present day.… The first word of the Torah dispels
the darkness of this false belief; and the words, ‘The opening of thy word giveth
light’ (Ps. cxix. 130), have in the Midrash correctly been applied to the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span>. Everything, the matter and the form of all beings, is the result of the free will
of the Creator, who continues to rule matter and form, and to determine both the natural
forces and the laws of their action. For it is His free will that created matter,
endowed it with certain forces, and fixed the laws by which the forces impress the
different forms on it.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>The idea of development and evolution is not entirely excluded from the account of
the Creation. Not in one moment or in one day was the universe produced, but in six
days by successive creations of a systematic order. In Mishnah Aboth (v. 1) this is
expressed in the following way: “By ten words (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מאמרות‎</span>) the universe was created, although this could have been done by one word.” Commentators
have variously attempted to explain this fact, and to show that the order observed
in the Creation was determined by the nature of the things themselves. Thus Ibn Ezra
believes that the successive creations were the results of the continued action of
light and heat.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5748src" href="#xd32e5748">17</a> But it is by no means necessary to reconcile the Biblical account with every theory
that happens to be considered by some scholar or school as the right one. There may
be found in nature and in the working of the natural laws some facts analogous to
certain acts of the creation; but a perfect equality of two such incongruent things
as the creation from nothing and development of created beings is impossible. By forcing
the text of the Bible into such harmony we deprive the account of its poetry and beauty,
and weaken the force of its teaching.
</p>
<p>Science teaches that millions of millions of years must have elapsed before the earth
received its present form; that it took millions of years before the light of certain
stars could reach the earth. In all these calculations one important factor is ignored,
viz., that for every development something must be given, which is subject to the
process of developing; to determine in what condition that something was, when it
passed from the passive state of creation to the active state of developing, is a
problem for the solution of which there is no analogy in nature. He who could create
a germ endowed with all the natural forces required for <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>development and differentiation into the great variety of forms which we perceive
at present, must certainly have been able to create the things actually endowed with
these forms. Thus, also, the various strata of the earth, whatever forms they contain,
cannot with certainty be described as the results of development; they may just as
well have come directly from the hand of the Creator.
</p>
<p>Maimonides (The Guide, xxx.) says in reference to this question: “You should also
know the dictum of our Sages—‘All the beings of the work in the beginning (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה בראשית‎</span>) were created in their full height, their fully developed reason, and endowed with
the best of properties.’ Note this, for it involves an important principle.—The work
of the Creation went on for six days; every day brought to light a new force, a new
result of a creative action, but on the seventh day ‘God declared<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5761src" href="#xd32e5761">18</a> the work which He had done as finished,’ as endowed with the properties and forces
required for their further development” (The Guide, I. lxvii.).
</p>
<p>Science has proved, it is maintained, that the earth does not form the centre of the
universe, and that man does not form the principal object in nature, in opposition
to the teaching of the Scriptures that the earth is the centre round which the whole
universe revolves, and that man on earth is the lord of the creation. Whatever view
the authors of the Biblical books held as regards the systems of the universe, whether
they placed the earth in the centre or not, whether all the stars and systems of stars
existed, in their opinion, only for the sake of the earth or for the benefit of man,
their object was to address man, to instruct him, and to teach him the omnipotence,
wisdom, and goodness of God. For <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>this reason the account of the Creation is given in such a manner that man should
be able to reproduce in his mind the work of each day of the Creation, to view it
from his standpoint, and to recognise the benefits each day’s work bestowed on him.
The fact that other beings are benefited at the same time, and that the benefit they
derive is likewise part of the Creator’s design, is by no means denied by those who
believe that the well-being of man was included in the design of the Creator. It is
part of our duty of gratitude to ascribe the benefits we enjoy to their Author. The
prophets and the inspired singers knew well the place which weak and mortal man occupies
in the universe; but they did not ignore the dignity and importance with which the
Creator endowed him in spite of all his weakness and apparent insignificance. “<i>What is man</i>,” exclaims the Psalmist, “<i>that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? And yet
thou hast made him a little lower than angels, and hast crowned him with glory and
honour</i>” (Ps. viii. 5, 6).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.5"><i>On the Fifth Principle</i>, p. 44.
</p>
<p>The principle that no other being but God is worthy of being addressed in prayer implies
the belief that God can fulfil our petitions. We believe in the efficacy of prayer.
It is true that when we communicate our wishes to the Most Holy, our just Lord and
our loving Father, we are <i>eo ipso</i> reminded to examine our desires, whether they contain anything unholy, anything unjust
or ignoble. Prayer to God has therefore the salutary effect of purifying, refining,
and ennobling our heart. It banishes evil thoughts, and thus saves us much pain and
sorrow. This effect may have been designed by the Creator, and it may be for this
purpose that He has endowed us with a natural impulse to pray, and has taught us to
pray in His Holy Word. But this cannot <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>be the direct object of prayer. The immediate effect sought to be obtained by this
act is the fulfilment of our wishes. Every such fulfilment implies a miracle, a deviation
from the regular course of nature. We are not in the habit of praying for things which
we expect as the sure result of the natural laws; we may praise and admire nature
in its workings, but we shall never ask nature for the fulfilment of our desires.
Only those things which we believe to be dependent solely on the free decision of
the Supreme Being can form the substance of our petitions; and since we believe that
everything, the regular working of the natural laws not excepted, depends on the Will
of God, we include in the objects of prayer whatever concerns the well-being of individual
man and society at large.
</p>
<p>There have been thinkers that formed such an idea of God that they were compelled
to deny Him every direct influence on human affairs. Some thought it incompatible
with the notion of God’s Unity and Immutability that He should be moved by man’s prayer
to do something which otherwise He would not have done. Again, others believe that
the laws of nature—whether given by God or not—are so permanent that they never change
under any circumstances. Prayer has therefore been explained to be of a purely subjective
character, and to effect only the above-mentioned improvement of man’s heart. But
could we really pray to God to grant us the one thing or the other if we were convinced
that He cannot grant us anything, but must allow nature to take its course? Can a
prayer offered in such a frame of mind be called a “prayer without lips of deceit”?
In opposition to such theories our teachers purposely introduced into the daily prayer
here and there a reminder of the true theory in words like the following: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המחדש בטובו בכל יום תמיד מעשה בראשית‎</span> “Who repeateth anew every day regularly the work of the Creation.” He is constantly
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוצר אור‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בורא חשך‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מחיה המתים‎</span>; <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>He constantly “formeth light,” “createth darkness,” “giveth life to the dead,” &amp;c.;
they have expressed our gratitude to God <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על <span class="corr" id="xd32e5811" title="Source: נסיך">נסים</span> שבכל יום עמנו ועל נפלאתיך וטובתיך שבכל עת‎</span> “for His miracles which in our behalf He performs every day, and for His wonders
and kindnesses shown at all times.”
</p>
<p>“This idea of God’s real and active rule in the universe is the basis of prayer. It
is not only the belief in the truth of the Biblical account of miracles that enables
us to pray to our Father, but the conviction that wonders and miracles are constantly
wrought by Him. In the Talmud and in the Midrash man’s earning his daily bread (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרנסה‎</span>) is declared to be a miracle by no means inferior to the miracles wrought for the
deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt.—‘Is need greatest, is God nearest,’ is a
well-known saying, the truth of which many have experienced in the course of their
life. Those who have been dangerously ill, and after having found that man, with all
his science and resources, was incapable of affording relief, gradually recover their
former health; those who have shared with others a common danger, and while their
companions, under exactly the same circumstances, perished, were themselves saved;
those who, having exhausted every means conceivable to them of obtaining a livelihood,
at length find a new path of subsistence opened to them: all these have experienced
the Divine help and His nearness in their distress; they have learnt to recognise
the miraculous power of Providence. But it is not only in such extraordinary events
that the finger of God is seen; to him who has eyes to see they appear daily and hourly.
We are exposed to many dangers, the existence of which we frequently only learn when
we are safe; we escape them by a miracle.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5821src" href="#xd32e5821">19</a>
</p>
<p>The Immutability of God and of His decrees is frequently <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>insisted upon in Scripture. “I, the Lord, I change not” (Mal. iii. 6). “God is not
a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent” (Num. xxiii.
19). “The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he
should repent” (1 Sam. xv. 29). “And he hath established them for ever and ever: he
hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away” (Ps. cxlviii. 6).—This immutability,
however, does not interfere with the free-will of man and its consequences. The teaching
of the Bible is beautifully expressed in the well-known sentence: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תשובה תפלה וצדקה מעבירין את רע הגזרה‎</span> “Repentance, prayer, and good deeds remove the evil of the divine decree” (Musaf
of Rosh ha-shanah); whatever a man has forfeited by evil deeds, he may recover by
prayer and improved conduct. This lesson is taught in the Bible on every page, and
is illustrated by the history of Israel. For this reason the prophets were sent to
the people of Israel to exhort them, and to show them how they could, by means of
repentance, ward off the impending catastrophe. To non-Israelites the same mercy was
extended, as is shown by the history of the mission of the prophet Jonah.—Mishnah
Aboth (iv. 13) therefore declares, “Repentance and good deeds are like a shield against
punishment,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תשובה ומעשים טובים כתריס בפני הפרענות‎</span>.
</p>
<p>The seeming incongruity of the two principles, God’s immutability and man’s hope for
mercy and pardon from God, has to some extent occupied the attention of our ancient
teachers. “If our condition for a whole year is determined in advance, what is the
good of our daily prayers and our supplication for God’s help in times of trouble?”
Such is the question asked in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh ha-shanah (16<i>a</i>), and the answer is given, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יפה צעקה קודם גזרה ואחר גזרה‎</span> “Prayer is of good effect both before the decree and afterwards.” It is always in
the power and in <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>the will of the Almighty to accede to our petitions and to fulfil our wishes. The
question has since been repeated frequently, but no better solution has as yet been
supplied.
</p>
<p>Abraham, who was the first teacher of monotheism, has also been made by tradition
the father of prayer. In the Biblical account he is the first who uttered a prayer;
a prayer in the true sense of the word, not for himself, but for his fellow-men. The
words of Cain, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גדול עוני מנשא‎</span> “My punishment is greater than I can bear,” have not the character of prayer, nor
can the “calling by the name of God” in the age of Enosh be considered with certainty
as an expression of prayer. Tradition relates, therefore, that before Abraham there
was no one that called God by the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדון‎</span> “Lord.” Abraham was the first who recognised God as Lord of man, in whose hand his
fate lies,—the condition <i>sine quâ non</i> of prayer. From Abraham onwards prayer remained the chief refuge in danger, and the
best, solace and relief in time of trouble.
</p>
<p>Whilst, however, insisting on the belief in the efficacy of prayer, our Sages teach
us that it would be wrong to expect that every petition uttered before God must be
granted. We pray to the Almighty, being convinced that it is in His power to grant
what we pray for; but we must trust in the wisdom and mercy of God, that the rejection
of our petition is also for our good. “He is near to all those who call on him, to
all those that call on him in truth,” who continue to trust in Him and His goodness
even when their wishes are not fulfilled. It would be almost equal to superstition
to believe that any words, however earnest and devout, uttered by us will infallibly
have the desired effect. The Mishnah (Aboth ii. 13) therefore teaches: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל תעש תפלתך קבע אלא רחמים ותחנונים‎</span> “Do not make thy prayer a fixed claim or demand, which must be fulfilled, but a supplication
for mercy, which may or may not be granted.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>The belief that the prayer will undoubtedly be fulfilled is denounced in the Talmud
as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיון תפלה‎</span> “Looking out with certainty for the effect of the prayer.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5866src" href="#xd32e5866">20</a> Since the principal object of prayer is the granting of our petitions, prayer will
be superfluous when no wants will any longer be felt, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לעתיד לבוא התפלות בטלות‎</span> “In future prayers will be discontinued;” only <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלת תודה אינה בטלה לעולם‎</span> “The prayer of thanksgiving will never be discontinued.” “In the enjoyment of the
purest blessings our feelings of gratitude will never die out” (Yalkut on Ps. lvi.).
</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph Albo, in the book <i>Ikkarim</i>, says (IV. xvi.): “Although Prayer is not one of the principles of our Torah, it
is intimately connected with the belief in Providence, and every one who believes
in Providence ought to believe in the efficacy of prayer. For he who does not pray
to God in time of trouble either does not believe in Divine Providence, or if he does
believe, he doubts whether God is able to supply his wants; in both cases man is an
unbeliever. It is also possible that a person who believes in Divine Providence and
in God’s Omnipotence doubts whether he deserves that his prayer should be granted—a
feeling of humility which ought indeed to fill the heart of every person—but this
idea must not prevent him altogether from praying to God concerning his wants. If
he does not pray from this reason, he may believe in God’s justice, but he does not
believe in His mercy and kindness. It is also contrary to the teaching of the Bible.
‘Not relying on our righteousness do we offer our supplication before you, but on
your great mercy!’ For the benefits bestowed by God on His creatures are acts of love,
not of recompense.… Man receives benefits, whether he is entitled to them or not,
because prayer gives him a qualification which he does not possess by nature, and
enables <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>him to receive such good things as could not be obtained from any other being or through
any other means.…
</p>
<p>“There are some who doubt the efficacy of prayer; they argue thus: We must assume
that a certain good thing has been either decreed or not decreed in favour of a certain
person: if it has been decided, prayer is not wanted; and if it has not been decided,
how can prayer effect a change in the Will of God, who is unchangeable? Neither righteousness
in action, nor prayer, is of any avail in procuring any good thing that has not been
ordained, or in escaping any evil that has been decreed. This is also the argument
of Job in chap. xxi. But the answer to these arguments is this: Whatever may have
been decreed, certain conditions must be fulfilled before the decree is executed.
If a good harvest is decreed to a certain person, he must plough and sow before he
can secure such a harvest; if punishment is decreed against him, the punishment is
not inflicted in the absence of continued and repeated sinning. The history of King
Ahab shows that the evil decreed against any sinner takes no effect if the sinner
repents and is turned into another man. The change that takes place in man himself
is the direct effect of prayer and righteousness; it prepares and qualifies him for
receiving benefits and protection from evil. Our Sages say therefore: Prayer has its
good effect both before and after the Divine decree. The Immutability of God is not
less consistent with Efficacy of Prayer than it is with His knowledge of things which
are possible, and may happen or may not happen. God and His knowledge being unchangeable,
everything must be certain and nothing merely possible. And yet we are convinced of
the existence of these things, and believe at the same time in the Immutability of
God’s knowledge. In the same manner we are convinced of the Efficacy of Prayer without
doubting the Immutability of God’s Will.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch1.n.5.1"><i>On Revelation, p. 46.</i>
</p>
<p>The term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span> “prophet” only expressed the prophet’s function of addressing his fellow-men when
inspired and impelled by the Spirit of the Lord. The verb “to prophesy” is therefore
in Hebrew expressed by the <i>nifal</i> or passive. In so far as the Word of God has been revealed to him he is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ראה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חוזה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צפה‎</span> “Seer,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איש אלהים‎</span> “Man of God,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איש הרוח‎</span> “The inspired.” In the time of Samuel the title <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ראה‎</span> was generally given to the prophet instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span> (1 Sam. ix. 9), as his advice was also sought by many who believed him to be able
to foresee coming events and to know everything. As, however, the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span> only describes the prophet as addressing his fellow-men, it is used both of the true
and the false prophets, and also of teachers and preachers generally. The Targum on
the Prophets (Jer. xxix. 15; Isa. xxix. 10) renders, therefore, the term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span> in some instances: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלפין‎</span> “teachers,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספריא‎</span> “scholars.”
</p>
<p>The enthusiasm manifested by the prophet in his mode of address, or in his endurance
of insult and ill-treatment, made him sometimes appear in the eyes of the public as
though he were struck with madness, so that scoffers used <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נביא‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משגע‎</span> “mad,” as synonyms (Jer. xxix. 26), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתנבא‎</span> is both one who acts as a prophet and one who imitates the appearance of a prophet
(1 Sam. xviii. 10).
</p>
<p>The false prophets are divided by Jeremiah into three classes: there were those who
were guilty of a direct plagiarism, preaching the Divine messages of the true prophets
and describing them as their own inspiration. There were others who plagiarised and
reproduced true prophecies in a form and style of their own, and others again who
altogether invented dreams and visions. The principal test for distinguishing <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>between the true and the false prophets was the purity of moral and religious conduct.
In matters wholly indifferent as regards morality and religion the prophet was believed
after having established his trustworthiness in some way or other, and his advice
was acted upon. The prophet himself could easily detect the fraud of a false prophet;
for what he was commanded by God to do, another prophet could not, speaking in the
name of the same God, order not to be done. The prophet, therefore, who deceitfully
induced “the man of God” to return to Beth-el by the very way which the word of God
had forbidden him to go again (1 Kings xiii. 18), could not have been a true prophet,
although he was subsequently entrusted with a Divine message for “the man of God.”
Bileam was likewise for a certain purpose made the bearer of God’s words, although
he was by no means a good man. In either case the sinful intention of the false prophet
was stigmatised as contrary to the Will of the Most High, and both had, as it were,
to own the wickedness of their intention or the wrong of their actions.
</p>
<p>The subject-matter of the prophecy is called “the vision,” “the word of God,” or “the
burden of the word of God.” In the days of Jeremiah the term “burden of the Lord”
seems to have been used contemptuously of the prophetic utterances in the sense of
“trouble” and “strife” (comp. Deut. i. 12), and the prophet was ironically asked by
the people, “What is the burden of the Lord?” Jeremiah exhorts them to say, “What
hath the Lord answered thee?” or “What hath the Lord spoken?” “But the burden of the
Lord shall ye remember no more; for the burden shall be the man’s to whom His word
is brought” (Jer. xxiii. 36).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch1.n.6"><i>On the Sixth Principle</i>, p. 131.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.6.1"><i>Saadiah</i> in <i>Emunoth ve-deoth</i> iii. says: “Some men believe that we have no need of prophets, our reason being able
to distinguish between good and evil. But if this were the case, God would not have
sent messengers to us, because He does not do a thing that is purposeless. I considered
the question thoroughly, and found that the mission of the prophets was necessary,
not only for the promulgation of categorical commands, but also for that of rational
precepts. Thus the duty of thanksgiving to God for His goodness is dictated by our
own reason, but the Divine messengers had to fix the time and the form of thanksgiving.
Again, adultery is rejected by our reason as a crime; but the Divine teaching determines
the conditions of the bond that unites man and wife.…
</p>
<p>“As a test of the prophet’s truthfulness and trustworthiness a sign is given, which
consists of an act implying a deviation from the ordinary laws of nature (comp. Exod.
iii. and iv.). The Israelites are therefore frequently reminded of ‘the great wonders
which their eyes saw’ (Deut. vii. 19). Those who believed after the sign was given
were ‘the righteous,’ whilst those who did not believe ‘went astray.’ …
</p>
<p>“The object of ‘the wonders’ was to produce belief in the prophecies; except for such
a purpose as this, the regular course of Nature is not disturbed, so that man can
make his plans and arrange his affairs on the basis of the continuance of the laws
of Nature. The messengers sent by God were not angels, but men like ourselves, in
order that the force of the sign may be more apparent; for, seeing that beings like
ourselves perform things which we cannot perform, we conclude that a higher Being
has endowed them with extraordinary power for a special purpose. If, however, angels
had been chosen for the task of prophets, we should not have considered <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>their performance as signs; but, not knowing the nature of angels, we should have
thought that such acts were within the regular and natural powers of angels. Prophets,
like other human beings, cannot dispense with the regular functions of the organs
of their body; they are subject to the different conditions of health; to poverty,
ill-treatment on the part of their fellow-men, and to ignorance about future events,
except those communicated to them by Divine inspiration.—I found it necessary to state
this here, because there are people who believe that the prophet does not die like
ordinary people; others deny him the sensation of hunger and thirst; others again
think that he does not suffer from violence and wrong directed against him, and some
even believe that nothing is hidden from him. These ‘do not know the thoughts of the
Lord, and do not understand His counsel.’
</p>
<p>“It is, further, my conviction that the prophets were satisfied, by some extraordinary
supernatural phenomena, that they were addressed by the Almighty. (Comp. Exod. xxxiii.
9 and Ps. xcix. 7: ‘In a pillar of cloud he speaketh to them.’)
</p>
<p>“As to the relation of the Egyptian Magicians to Moses, we are informed that ten miracles
were wrought by Moses and only three by the Magicians. Even these three were only
mentioned in order to show the difference between Moses and the Magicians. Moses acted
openly, the Magicians secretly; the effect of Moses’ doing was felt throughout the
whole country, that of the Magicians only in a limited space.…
</p>
<p>“Some one might ask, ‘How could Jonah have been chosen for his mission? Wisdom would
forbid us to appoint for an important mission a messenger that is disobedient.’ But
I have examined the Book of Jonah, and have not found any statement as regards the
disobedience of Jonah. On the contrary, I assume that he, like all prophets, brought
the Divine message to the Ninevites. We frequently find in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>Pentateuch. ‘Speak to the children of Israel and tell them,’ and we assume that Moses
told the Israelites, although this is not distinctly mentioned. The reason why Jonah
fled is this: the first message which he actually brought to the inhabitants of Nineveh
contained simply a summons to repentance. He feared that he would be again sent to
threaten with punishment if they did not return; and if they returned and the threatened
catastrophe did not occur, they might in course of time begin to doubt the veracity
of his words. He therefore left the land, which was distinguished as the land of prophecy
(Jonah iv. 2).”
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.6.2"><i>Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi</i>, in the book <i>Cuzari</i> (V. xii.), describes prophecy as an extraordinary gift granted by the Almighty to
such human beings as are qualified for it by the highest degree of intellectual development,
moral conduct, and an earnest desire for communion with God. Such qualification is
found only in a few privileged individuals—“the heart of mankind” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לב האדם‎</span>)—who, as it were, possess it as an inheritance transmitted from generation to generation,
but it can only be possessed or acquired under certain favourable conditions, <i>e.g.</i>, that the prophet live in Palestine, the land of prophecy, or have his attention
directed to Palestine (I. xcv.).
</p>
<p>It was, however, necessary that mankind should derive a benefit from the revelations
made to the prophets. All had to learn that it was possible for a human being to receive
a direct communication from God. This lesson was given when the Israelites stood round
Mount Sinai, and suddenly became prophets. For, although the Israelites believed in
the Divine mission of Moses after he had done many wonderful deeds, there remained
yet a doubt in their minds whether God could speak to man, and whether the Torah did
not originate in the plans and schemes of human beings, which by the help and assistance
of God developed <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>to perfection; for it seemed strange to them to ascribe speech, which is corporeal,
to a spiritual being. It is this doubt which God intended to remove from their hearts;
they were therefore commanded to sanctify themselves inwardly and outwardly, whereby
they were prepared for the condition of prophets and for hearing the words of God
which were to be directly addressed to them. After a preparation of three days they
received the Decalogue, not from any prophet or other person, but from God Himself.
But they felt their weakness and their inability to witness such a great sight again.
They were convinced that the Torah was communicated by God to Moses, and was not the
result of human invention; that prophecy does not consist in the union of the soul
of man with the active intellect, in his attaining to great wisdom, or in his mistaking
his own words for the words of God. Such erroneous opinions were refuted by the revelation
on Mount Sinai.—But, objects the king of the Cuzarites, to believe that God spoke
to the Israelites and wrote the Decalogue on the tables of stone amounts to believing
in a corporeification of the Deity.—To which objection the following reply is given:—“Far
be it from us to think that the Torah contains anything contrary to reason. The Decalogue
commences with the commandment to believe in God, and prohibits in the second commandment
the representation of God in any corporeal form. How could we, who deny corporeality
even to some of His creatures, attribute any corporeal property to the Supreme Being?
For it is not the tongue, heart, or brain of Moses that speaks to us, instructs and
guides us, but his soul which is rational, incorporeal, and not subject to the relations
of space; we ascribe to the soul attributes of angels, of spiritual beings. How much
more is this the case with God! We have, therefore, no reason for rejecting the Biblical
account of the revelation on Mount Sinai; but we admit that we <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>do not know how the idea became corporeal and was turned into audible speech, what
new thing was then created or what things then in existence were annihilated. He is
Almighty, and when we say that He created the tablets and covered them with His writing,
it was done, like the creation of the heavens, by His word; that is, it was His Will
that His thought should become corporeal to a certain extent and assume the form of
tables, and that a certain writing be inscribed on them. Just as the division of the
sea and the formation of a broad path between the walls of water was done directly
by His Will, without using instruments or employing intermediate causes, so the air
that reached the ear of the prophet assumed such a form that sounds were perceived
expressing the idea which God desired to communicate to the prophet or to the people”
(I., lxxxvii.–lxxxix.). In describing the different meanings of the names of God,
<i>Elohim</i> and the <i>Tetragrammaton</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5992src" href="#xd32e5992">21</a> the author says: “The nature of <i>Elohim</i> can be perceived by reason, which teaches us that there exists a being who governs
the universe. The opinions at which people arrive vary according to the different
modes of reasoning which they employ; the opinions of the philosophers have the greatest
probability. But the idea contained in the <i>Tetragrammaton</i> cannot be found by reasoning, but is perceived intuitively by that prophetic vision
during which man is almost separated from his fellow-men, transformed into an angel,
and filled with another spirit; … previous doubts concerning God disappear, he smiles
at the arguments by which men generally arrive at the idea of a deity and unity; he
then worships God in love, and would rather sacrifice his life than abandon the worship
of God” (IV., xv.).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch1.n.6.3"><i>Abraham Ibn Ezra</i> explains the words “And the Lord spake to Moses” as referring to true speech and
not to speech with the mouth, which is merely a representation of the other. “God
spake to Moses” as man speaketh to his neighbour; that is to say, directly and not
through a messenger (On Exod. xxxiii. 11).—In commenting on the Nineteenth Psalm he
says: “The first part shows how the intelligent man can find in nature evidence for
the existence and power of the Deity; but there is a far better and more trustworthy
witness: the Law, &amp;c, called by David ‘perfect,’ because no other evidence is required
in support of the Divine utterances contained in the Holy Writings” (On Ps. xix. 8).—Ibn
Ezra is so firm in his belief in the truth of the Divine Writings that he sets aside
the contrary opinions of men as absurd. “We believe in the words of our God and abandon
the vain opinions of the sons of man” (On Gen. vii. 19).—Whatever message they brought
from God was true, and its realisation could be relied upon provided that the conditions
were fulfilled, which were either expressed or implied. In other things, however,
which were not contained in the Divine message they were not infallible (On Exod.
iv. 20). The prophets were trained for the office. The sons of the prophets (or “the
disciples”) led a contemplative life of seclusion, in the hope of receiving inspiration,
every one according to his faculty (On Exod. iii. 15). The first step in this preparation
was “the training in the fear of the Lord,” which leads man to heed the negative precepts
of the Law. Then follows “the worship of God,” which includes the observance of all
positive precepts (Yesod Mora, vii.).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.6.4"><i>Maimonides</i> (Mishneh torah, I.; Yesode ha-torah, vii. 1):—“One of the principles of our faith
is to believe that God inspires men. The inspiration can only take place in men who
distinguish themselves by great wisdom and moral <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>strength; who are never overcome by any passion, but, on the contrary, overcome all
passions; who possess wide and profound knowledge. If those who are endowed with these
various gifts, and, being physically perfect, enter the garden of speculation, are
absorbed in these great and difficult problems, have the mind to understand and to
comprehend, sanctify themselves more and more, abandon the ways of the common people
that walk in the deep darkness of the time, and zealously train themselves in freeing
their mind from useless things, the vanities and tricks of the time, in order always
to keep the mind free for reflecting on higher things, on the most holy and pure forms,
on the whole work of the Divine Wisdom from the first sphere to the centre of the
earth, and to comprehend thereby the greatness of God: then they will at once be inspired
with the holy spirit, their soul will then be in the society of angels, they will
become other beings, they will feel that they are not the same as before, that they
are above other men, even above the wise. Thus it is said of Saul, ‘And thou wilt
prophesy with them, and be turned into another man’ ” (1 Sam. x. 6).
</p>
<p>The same opinion is expressed by Maimonides in his “Commentary on the Mishnah” (Sanhedrin,
xi. 1), and in “The Guide” (III., xxxii.). In the latter (<i>l.c.</i>) the various views on prophecy are fully discussed, and the difference between the
view of Maimonides and that of the “philosophers” is given more distinctly. According
to the philosophers, the highest physical, moral, and intellectual development is
the sole means for the acquisition of the prophetic faculty. Maimonides demands in
addition to this the Divine Will; he reserves, as it were, for the Supreme Being a
kind of veto, and believes that the prophetic faculty may, by Divine <span class="corr" id="xd32e6028" title="Source: terference">interference</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, by a miracle, be withheld from a person in spite of all preparation and fitness.
He compares this interference to the sudden paralysis and equally sudden recovery
<span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>of the hand of King Jeroboam (1 Kings xiii. 4). Although the physical conditions for
the motion of the hand were present, the motion could not take place, because it was
the Will of God that the hand should at that particular time not be able to perform
its natural functions.
</p>
<p>The question naturally suggests itself, Why, then, is the number of prophets so exceedingly
small? Why are there no prophets amongst the large host of philosophers whose intellectual
faculties have been most highly developed, and who apparently live in a sphere of
ideals far above earthly and ordinary passions? Maimonides denies the fact that the
conditions are fulfilled; he believes that the life of the philosophers is on the
whole not so pure as would qualify them for the office of prophecy (II., xxxvi.).
</p>
<p>But Bileam, Laban, and Abimelech enjoyed the privilege of Divine communication, although
they had not attained to the highest degree of moral sanctity. Maimonides says in
reference to the dreams of Abimelech and Laban (<i>ibid.</i>, chap. xli.): “The sentence, ‘And Elohim (an angel) came to a certain person in the
dream of the night,’ does not indicate a prophecy, and the person to whom Elohim appeared
is not a prophet; the phrase only informs us that the attention of the person was
called by God to a certain thing, and at the same time that this happened at night.
For just as God may cause a person to move in order to save or kill another, so He
may cause, according to His Will, certain things to rise in man’s mind in a dream
by night. We have no doubt that the Syrian Laban was a wicked man and an idolater.
Abimelech, though himself a virtuous man, is told by Abraham, ‘I said, Surely there
is no fear of God in this place’ (Gen. xx. 11). And yet of both it is said that Elohim
appeared to them in a dream. Note and consider the distinction between the phrases
‘Elohim came’ and ‘Elohim said;’ between ‘in a <i>dream</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>by night’ and ‘in a <i>vision</i> by night.’ In reference to Jacob it is said, ‘And an angel said to Israel in visions
by night’ (Gen. xlvi. 2), whilst in reference to Abimelech and Laban it is said, ‘Elohim
came to Abimelech (or to Laban) in the dream by night’ (<i>Ibid.</i> xx. 3 and xxxi. 24). Onkelos therefore renders this phrase: ‘A word came from the
Lord,’ and not ‘God revealed himself.’ ”
</p>
<p>Bileam is, according to Maimonides, in some respect like Laban and Abimelech; what
God told him in a dream by night was not a prophecy. In other respects he is described
by this philosopher as a person endowed with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח הקדש‎</span> “the holy spirit;” <i>i.e.</i>, he felt that some influence had come upon him, and that he had received a new power
which encouraged him to speak for a certain object (The Guide, xlv.). Maimonides adds
that at that time Bileam was still a virtuous man.—This view of the position which
Bileam occupies in the class of inspired men is different from the place assigned
to him in the Midrash, where the following passage occurs: “ ‘There arose no prophet
again in Israel like Moses;’ that is to say, in Israel none arose, but among other
nations there was a prophet as great as Moses, namely, Bileam” (Sifre, Deut. xxxiv.
10). Whatever may be the meaning of these words—whether they are meant as a satire
or not—they seem to indicate that Bileam possessed a high degree of prophetic faculty.
But comparing the deeds of Bileam with those of Moses, we find that the latter guided
the Israelites and led them to good deeds and to a virtuous life, whilst Bileam misled
those who followed his guidance to sin and vice.
</p>
<p>The view of Maimonides, that man after due preparation and training may still be debarred
from the rank of prophet, is severely criticised by the Commentators of the Guide.
They maintain that God, after having invited and encouraged man to approach Him, would
not then thwart <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>the very hope He had implanted. According to their opinion, God’s hand is extended
to all; every one may acquire the prophetic faculty, and those who have not acquired
it have not been duly qualified for it. (Comp. the Comm. of Ephodi, Narboni a. o.
on “The Guide,” II., xxxii.).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.6.5">Albo (Ikkarim, III., vii. <i>sqq.</i>) likewise admits that it is impossible to imagine a prophet who has not attained
a high degree of moral and intellectual perfection. But he does not consider the prophetic
faculty as a natural development of man’s intellectual faculties. It is solely and
directly due to Divine inspiration (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפע אלהי‎</span>), by means of which man acquires a knowledge of things which are otherwise beyond
the limits of human intellect. Of what nature the inspiration is, how it gives certitude
to the prophet, and by what psychical process it is accomplished, only the prophet
himself can fully comprehend. Albo, like Maimonides, assumes different degrees of
inspiration from the inspiration (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח ה׳‎</span>) which moved Samson to heroic deeds and David to sacred songs, to the prophetic communion
of Moses with God “face to face.” The clearness of the prophet’s utterances varies
according to the different degrees of his prophetic faculty, although all are equally
true.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.7"><i>On the Seventh Principle</i>, p. 133.
</p>
<p>The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שנבואת משה רבנו ע׳׳ה היתה אמתית‎</span> have been wrongly translated “that the prophecy of Moses was true,” because this
is contained in the sixth principle, which applies equally to Moses and to all other
prophets. The term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמתית‎</span> does here not denote “true,” but “real,” “perfect,” or “direct;” and the difference
between the Divine inspiration of Moses and that of other prophets is expressed in
the above phrase, in accordance with the distinction made in the Pentateuch (Num.
xii. 8). It has been considered necessary <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>to formulate this distinction between Moses and other prophets in a separate article,
because it is of great importance in the proof of the Immutability of the Law.
</p>
<p>Maimonides in “The Guide” (chap. xxxv.) and Mishneh torah (I., Hilchoth Yesode ha-torah
vii. 6) fully describes the difference between Moses and other prophets. He enumerates
four points:—(1.) Other prophets received the Divine message in a vision or a dream,
whilst Moses received it in a state of complete consciousness, being awake, and apprehending
the words like those spoken by a man to his fellow-men. (2.) Other prophets received
the message in images, which they had first to interpret before communicating it to
their fellow-men; Moses was addressed by God in clear words and not in figurative
speech. (3.) Other prophets were overcome by the sight, and were in a state of fear
and trembling; Moses experienced nothing of this kind. (4.) Moses was sure to receive
a Divine reply whenever he sought it; not so the other prophets.
</p>
<p>Maimonides comes thus to the conclusion that the term “prophet” when applied to Moses
cannot have the same meaning as it has when applied to other Divine messengers; and
the prophecy of Moses differs from that of other prophets not only in degree, but
in kind. There are, however, other theologians who hold that the prophecy of Moses
is of the same kind as that of other prophets, and excels the rest only by a higher
degree of prophetic faculty. (Comp. Albo Ikkarim, III., xvii.)
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8"><i>On the Eighth Principle</i>, p. 134.
</p>
<p>The integrity and authenticity of the Pentateuch has been subjected to all kinds of
tests by critics of every age. The Massoretic remarks, to which allusions are found
in the Talmud, seem to include the result of critical examination of the text of the
Bible. Thus we read in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>treatise Aboth di-Rabbi Nathan (chap. xxxiv.): “There are ten passages in the Pentateuch
which are provided with points on the top of the letters, namely, Gen. xvi. 5; xviii.
9; xix. 33; xxxiii. 4; xxxvii. 12; Num. iii. 39; ix. 10; xxi. 30; xxix. 15; Deut.
xxix. 28. What is the meaning of these points? Ezra—who is supposed to have added
them—said, ‘If Elijah should come and show me that the reading was wrong, I should
tell him that for that reason I marked them with points; and if he should say that
I wrote correctly, I should remove the points.’ ” In the treatise Soferim (vi. 4)
the following passage occurs:—“Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish said, Three copies of the Pentateuch
were found in the hall of the Temple; they are called <i>Sefer meonah</i>, <i>Sefer zatute</i>, and <i>Sefer hee</i>. In the one <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעון‎</span> was written instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעונה‎</span> (Deut. xxxiii. 27), in the other <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זאטוטי‎</span> (Exod. xxiv. 5) instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נערי‎</span>, and in the third eleven times <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היא‎</span> instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוא‎</span>. The reading that was found only in one of the three copies was rejected, and that
of the other two preferred. The received text has therefore <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעונה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נערי‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היא‎</span>.”
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.1">These instances which tradition has preserved, are evidence of the great care and
conscientiousness with which Ezra the Scribe and other men transcribed and multiplied
copies of the Pentateuch. We learn further from these instances that the text was
never altered, even where the sense did not seem quite clear; and where the reading
had been changed in some cases, the Massoretic notes show the way how to read the
word whilst the text was retained in its original form. This is the cause of the <i>Keri</i> and <i>Kethib</i>, “How the word is read” and “How it is written.” In the Talmud a certain number of
passages are described as <i>tikkun soferim</i>, “The style of the scribes;” others as <i>ittur soferim</i>, “Elegance of the scribes.” Commentators have interpreted these terms as indicating
alterations of the text; but the instances quoted for illustration do not contain
any trace of such a process. An instance of <i>tikkun soferim</i> is, <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>“And Abraham stood yet before the Lord” (Gen. xviii. 22). These words were believed
to continue the account of the Divine vision introduced by the words, “And God appeared
to Abraham” (<i>ibid.</i> xviii. 1), and interrupted by the narrative of the visit of the three angels. The
reader might have expected, “And God stood yet before Abraham.” The method of expressing
the same in the above form for the sake of euphemism is called <i>tikkun soferim</i>. From the instances of <i>ittur soferim</i> quoted in the Talm. Nedarim 37<i>b</i>, we infer that the occasional omission of the copulative <i>vav</i> was designated by that name. (Comp. Gen. xviii. 5, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחר‎</span>).
</p>
<p>In Midrashic interpretations of the Bible we frequently meet with the phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל תקרי‎</span>, “Do not read,” seemingly implying an emendation of the Biblical text. It is, however,
certain that the authors of such interpretations did not for a moment entertain the
idea that the passage in question was corrupt and required correction. What was meant
by the above phrase is this: A Jewish audience was supposed to be familiar with the
text of the Bible, and it was therefore believed that the lessons which the teacher
or preacher desired to impart would better reach the heart of the listener, and be
more easily retained in his memory, if it were expressed in the words of some Biblical
passage. If a passage could, by a slight alteration, be made to serve this purpose,
such alteration was adopted and introduced with the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל תקרי‎</span>, “Do not read, … but …”
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.2">There are also some instances in the Talmud and the Midrashim of Biblical quotations
not in harmony with the received text. This discrepancy is either due to the fact
that preachers and expounders quoted from memory, and may have erroneously confounded
two similar passages, or it is due to the carelessness of the copyists. Indications
of a Biblical text at variance with the received text are found in the ancient Versions.
But, with the exception of the Chaldee Version of the Pentateuch by Onkelos, and that
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>the Prophets by Jonathan, we have no authorised Version, and it is uncertain how many
of the discrepancies have their origin in a corrupt text in the hands of the translator,
and how many of them are due to the error of the translator in misreading or mistranslating
the correct text before him. By no means are these facts sufficient ground for doubting
the correctness of the received text, however plausible the suggested emendations
may appear.
</p>
<p>Samaritans and Mohammedans have accused the Jews of having altered the text of the
Bible; but they have not proved the charge. (See Emunah-ramah, 5th Principle, chap.
ii.)
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.3">Modern critics have impugned the authenticity of most of the Biblical books. We will
discuss their opinions concerning three of these books, and these are the most important
ones concerning which Tradition speaks most decidedly, viz., the Pentateuch, the Prophecies
of Isaiah, and the Book of Daniel.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.4">The existence of the Pentateuch at the time when the other Biblical books were written
is clear from the frequent references to the history and the laws contained in it.
Such are, <i>e.g.</i>: “Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according
to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded thee,” &amp;c. “This book of the law
shall not depart out of thy mouth,” &amp;c. (Jos. i. 7, 8). “As Moses, the servant of
the Lord, commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law
of Moses,” &amp;c. “And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which
he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. And afterward he read all the
words of the law, the blessing and <span class="corr" id="xd32e6176" title="Corrected by author from: cursings">cursing</span>, according to all that is written in the book of the law” (<i>Ibid.</i> viii. 31, 32, 34). “Keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to
keep his statutes and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as
it is written in the law of Moses,” &amp;c. (1 Kings <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>ii. 3). “But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which
is written in the book of the law of Moses,” &amp;c. (2 Kings xiv. 6). “Keep the passover
unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of the covenant” (<i>Ibid.</i> xxiii. 21). “Remember the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him in
Horeb for all Israel, statutes and judgments” (Mal. iii. 16).
</p>
<p>The authors of the other books of the Bible show familiarity with the words, the phrases,
and the contents of the Pentateuch. Thus Psalm civ. is based on the first chapter
of Genesis; the flood is mentioned in Ps. xxix. and in the prophecies of Isaiah (liv.
9); the history of the Patriarchs and of the Israelites in Egypt and in the wilderness
in Ps. cvi., lxxviii.; the history of Jacob is alluded to in Hosea xii.; the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah in Isa. i. 9, Amos iv. 11.
</p>
<p>Of the laws contained in the Pentateuch many are mentioned or alluded to in the books
of the Prophets and the Hagiographa; the feast of Passover (Jos. iv.), Tabernacles
(Zech. xiv. 16–20, Ezra iii. 4, Neh. viii. 14–18); the first day<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6188src" href="#xd32e6188">22</a> of the seventh month (New-year) is mentioned as a “holy day” (Neh. viii. 10). The
dietary laws are referred to by Isaiah (lxvi. 17); the laws of cleanness and uncleanness
form the text of a prophecy of Haggai (ii. 10 <i>sqq.</i>). Such phrases as “Uncircumcised in heart” (Jer. ix. 25) and “Thou wilt purify me
with hyssop and I shall be clean” (Ps. li. 9) show familiarity with the laws of the
Pentateuch. Sabbath and sacrifices are frequently mentioned. Critics, however, assert
that certain laws seem to have been unknown or out of practice in the period of the
Judges and the Kings. There is, <i>e.g.</i>, a perfect silence as to the celebration of “the Day of Blowing the shofar” and “the
Day of Atonement,” even where such <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>mention is suggested by the context, as Kings viii. 65, 66, and Nehemiah viii. But
the inspired historians preferred to describe the celebration of those festivals that
had been neglected, or those that were also of national and political importance by
concentrating the mass of the people in the capital; such festivals were Passover
and Tabernacles. The Day of Blowing the <i>shofar</i> and the Day of Atonement were set aside for quiet, private devotion and meditation,
the additional service in the Temple being in the hands of the priests, and the observation
of these days as holy days in accordance with the Law was a matter of course, and
was not considered by the authors as a memorable event that required special notice.
One of the prophecies of Isaiah (chap, lviii.) seems to have reference to the Day
of Atonement.
</p>
<p>That in the days of the Judges, when “every man did what was right in his eyes,” and
during the reign of wicked kings many laws were ignored or broken is not at all surprising.
When the sacrifices offered up by Samuel and Solomon are adduced as a proof that the
Law, which only allows priests to sacrifice, was not known in those days, the argument
is based on a misinterpretation of the Biblical text. When laymen brought sacrifices,
the priests performed the service for them; the principal thing to be mentioned was
in whose name or in whose presence the sacrifice was brought; it was unnecessary to
state that the priests had to sprinkle the blood and to burn certain portions upon
the altar; no one doubted it.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.5">Another argument against the authenticity of the Pentateuch has been based on the
fact related in the second book of Kings (xxii. 8 <i>sqq.</i>): “And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found a book
of the law in the house of the Lord. And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying,
Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
And it <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent
his clothes.” It is maintained by some scholars that the book, which seems to have
been an unknown thing to those who found it and to the king, had only just then been
written. This is not what is directly stated in the Bible. Hilkiah speaks of <i>the Law</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏התורה‎</span>, the well-known Torah; he would not have said so if the Torah had not been in existence
before. Furthermore, the king on hearing the words of the book rent his garments,
and sent to inquire of the Lord concerning the words of this book; for “great is the
wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us because <i>our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book</i>.” These words of the king clearly show that the king was convinced of the divine
character of the book, and also of its existence in the time of his forefathers. The
fact that King Josiah accuses “the fathers” suggests the following explanation of
the event:—During the reign of the wicked King Manasseh the reading of the Law was
interrupted; the book itself was hidden lest it should be destroyed by the idolatrous
priests; now that it was found again, the king was reminded that the Torah had been
neglected in the interval through the sin of the preceding generation. Whether there
was another copy of the Law in the Temple, whether the one found by Hilkiah was complete,
or contained only a portion of the Law, perhaps Deuteronomy, chap. xxvii. and chap.
xxviii., which are in the Pentateuch called “the words of this covenant” and also
“the words of the curse,” titles which occur also in reference to the above copy in
the books of Kings and Chronicles; to these and similar questions the Biblical account
gives no decided answer. Only so much is certain that the book found was not new or
unknown to those who found it, and the king recognised it as the book of the Torah.
</p>
<p>Far from finding in the other books of the Bible any evidence—whether positive or
negative—of the later origin <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>of the Torah, we feel convinced that their contents presuppose not only the existence
of the Torah, but also the authors’ familiarity with it. Without the Torah the other
books are unintelligible. There is nothing in the Pentateuch that betrays a post-Mosaic
origin. If the Pentateuch had been written in the period of the Kings, the author
would have mentioned Jerusalem as the appointed place for the Sanctuary; in the rebukes
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תוכחה‎</span>), in addition to idolatry, the social corruption pointed out by the prophets would
have been mentioned; the restrictive law concerning the marriage of heiresses would
have been superfluous, as it only applied to the first generation that entered Palestine.
</p>
<p>The phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבר הירדן‎</span> has been quoted as a proof that the author of the Pentateuch must have lived in Palestine,
or else he could not have called the east banks of the Jordan “the other side of Jordan;”
but this translation is wrong. The phrase only means the banks of Jordan.
</p>
<p>In the Talmud the Pentateuch in its entirety is ascribed to Moses. “Moses wrote his
book and the book of Bileam” (Babyl. Talm. Baba Bathra, 14<i>b</i>). The book of Bileam is the section of Numbers which contains the parables of Bileam
(from xxii. 2 to xxiv.).
</p>
<p>There is, however, a difference of opinion with regard to the last eight verses of
the Pentateuch. According to Rabbi Jehudah (or Rabbi Nehemiah) Joshua wrote this passage.
Rabbi Shimeon objected: “Is it possible that the Torah was incomplete when Moses was
told, ‘Take this book of the law?’ (Deut. xxxi. 26).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6231src" href="#xd32e6231">23</a> God dictated the last eight verses of the Pentateuch to Moses, and the latter wrote
them with tears.”
</p>
<p>With this exception, no doubt was entertained by any <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>of the Rabbis as to the integrity of the Torah. Various, however, were the opinions
as to the method followed by Moses in writing down the events and the laws. Rabbi
Jochanan, following the opinion of Rabbi Banaah, held that the Torah was written by
Moses piecewise at different times, just as the events happened or as each law was
revealed to him. Rabbi Shimeon ben Lakish said “it was given at one time in its entirety”
(Babyl. Talm. Gittin 60<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>Passages of the Torah which seemed to contradict each other, or to be contradicted
by statements found in other books of the Bible, were thoroughly discussed and explained.
The belief in the integrity and divinity of the Torah was so strong that those who
rejected either of these beliefs were considered as unworthy of the blessings of the
future world (Babyl. Talm. Sanhedrin 99<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>With the rise of Karaism Bible criticism received new encouragement, as in the warfare
between Karaism and Rabbinism, or Scripturalists and Traditionalists, it furnished
both sides with sharp weapons. Some, however, of the commentators went further, and
gave utterance to all sorts of heterodox views. Thus a certain Yitzchaki of Spain
was of opinion that Gen. xxxvi. 31–43 was a later addition, on account of the phrase,
“These were the kings who ruled over Edom before a king ruled over Israel.” The critics
forgot that this passage is intended to point out the advance which Esau’s descendants
had made, when the prophecy, “And kings shall come forth out of thee” (xxxv. 11) had
not yet been fulfilled in the case of the Israelites.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.6">Of the Commentators of the Middle Ages, Ibn Ezra is generally singled out as an advanced
scholar who held certain passages of the Pentateuch as later additions. Ibn Ezra was
far from such views, and he sharply rebuked those who entertained them. Thus he says
of Yitzchaki, the author of the above criticism, “Every one who will hear this will
<span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>laugh at him, and his book deserves to be burnt.” With equal vigour he criticises
a grammarian who pointed out certain passages as grammatically incorrect, and also
another scholar who in his interpretations of the Bible did not take sufficient notice
of the traditional accents. The error concerning Ibn Ezra has its origin in his habit
of adding the phrase, “The words have some deeper sense” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יש לו סוד‎</span>), whenever the literal interpretation does not quite satisfy him, or when the object
of the author in adding a seemingly superfluous sentence is not clear to him; as,
for instance, in the four passages referred to in the Commentary on Deuteronomy i.
2, namely, “The Canaanite was then in the land” (Gen. xii. 6), “On the mount of the
Lord will it appear” (<i>Ibid.</i> xxii. 14), the repetition of the sacrifices of the twelve princes (Num. vii.), and
the stations enumerated in Numbers (chap. xxxiii.), in addition to the detailed geographical
description of Deut. i. 1 <i>sqq.</i> The meaning of this remark has been misunderstood by the early expounders of Ibn
Ezra’s Commentary, and since then the mistake has been repeated by most of the critics
of the Bible. Spinoza, in his theological treatise, quotes Ibn Ezra, with the usual
misinterpretation, in support of his view concerning the Torah.
</p>
<p>Modern critics have attempted to analyse the Pentateuch, and to assign to it several
authors, revisers, and editors. But there is little harmony among the critics; the
one considers as the latest addition what the other holds to be the oldest portions
of the book. Numerous emendations are made by every one of them in order to establish
his special theory. The fundamental principle of most of them is that the section
in which the name <i>Elohim</i> is prevalent could not have been written by the author of another section in which
the <i>Tetragrammaton</i> is employed. But the two names, though denoting the same Being, are not identical
in meaning: the one signifies the Almighty, who is the Ruler of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>universe, the Master and Judge of all beings; the other is the name of the Merciful
Father, who reveals Himself to man, interferes in his behalf, and has especially revealed
His Providence and Kindness to the Israelites.
</p>
<p>A careful study of the Hebrew Bible will show that it is not the author, or the age
of the author, but the contents of the passage that determined which of the Divine
names was to be used. The same author repeats the same account with some variation,
according to the lesson which he intends to convey to the reader. The proofs which
are based on the differences discovered in two accounts of apparently the same event,
or on seeming contradictions or anachronisms, are so indifferently supported that
they are not able to conquer the fortress of Faith and Tradition. The difficulties
pointed out by the critics vanish before patient study and the earnest longing for
instruction and comfort offered by the Bible.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.7">The Book of Isaiah has likewise been subjected to the analytical test of the critic,
and it is generally believed that the prophecies contained in the book have not all
been written by the same author or in the same age. The book is divided into two large
sections; the second section, from chap. xl. to chap, lxvi., is thought to have been
composed shortly before the return of the Jews from Babylon. Although it is possible
that anonymous prophecies were added to a book, the reasons which induced critics
to make such a division are untenable. The first reason is the difference in style;
but we must take account of the difference in the contents of the two sections. The
prophecies in the first section have mostly a threatening tendency with regard to
imminent punishment, whilst in the second section Israel is to be encouraged in his
faith in the Almighty and in his hopes for a better future. It is but natural that
the style should not be the same in both sections. <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>Another reason for ascribing the second section to a later prophet is the fact that
Koresh (Cyrus), king of Persia, is mentioned by name, and the fall of Babylon and
the consequent deliverance of the Jews are described as well-known facts of the past.
This and similar arguments are based on a misunderstanding of the character of the
prophecies. The critics ignore the essential difference between the writings of inspired
messengers of God and those of ordinary men. They deny to the man of God the power
of foreseeing and foretelling coming events of which his fellow-men could not have
any knowledge. By such arguments the critics set limits to the power and wisdom of
God, and employ the same measure for both that which is Divine and that which is human.
A Divine prophet has, by the Will of the Almighty, the future unrolled before him;
he sees the catastrophe which is to come centuries later, and perceives its effect
and its end. Even when he reviews the present state of affairs and takes the immediate
future into consideration, his eyes frequently behold scenes and events of “the end
of the days” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏באחרית הימים‎</span>), which he points out as the goal of our hopes and aspirations. When he warns, advises,
or encourages his brethren with regard to their present wants, the virtues and the
happiness of the Messianic age are not rarely introduced. Earlier events, though still
future in time, appear then in the light of accomplished facts, and in their description
the past tense is used instead of the future. Thus it happened that the prophet Isaiah,
who flourished during the reign of King Hezekiah, could take his standpoint on the
return of the Jews from Babylonia, look back at the exile as a thing of the past,
and reveal to his brethren further troubles, the succeeding final redemption, and
the ultimate triumph of the faithful and God-fearing over the faithless and wicked.
</p>
<p>It is true that it is an unusual thing for a prophet to name a king who is to rule
centuries after the death of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>prophet, unless the name is a common noun, and has by its meaning some bearing on
the prophecy. The name Cyrus fulfils, perhaps, this condition; according to Ktesias,
it signifies “sun,” an appropriate name to be given to the king who is destined to
be the deliverer of a captive people. King Cyrus may have assumed this name when he
became convinced of the mission entrusted to him by Providence.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.8.8">The authenticity of the Book of Daniel has likewise been impugned, and its advocates
are, it must be admitted, at present very few. The narratives which the book contains
are considered as improbable or even impossible, and its visions as prophecies <i>ex facto</i>. It was written, according to these critics, in the period of the Maccabees, and
the name of Daniel was chosen in order to give more weight to the contents of the
book, Daniel being known as a man famous for his piety among his fellow-exiles. Against
this we have the distinct evidence in the book, in which the author is described as
the same Daniel that lived during the Babylonian exile; Jewish tradition knew of no
other author of the book than Daniel. Although the Book of Daniel was not placed amongst
the books of the Prophets, because he was not charged with any mission to his fellow-men,
the visions described in Daniel were nevertheless, in Jewish literature, considered
as true and genuine prophecy. The narratives have the distinct object to teach that
piety and firmness in obedience to the word of God can conquer the rage of the most
powerful tyrants; this tendency on the part of the author is especially noticed in
the manner in which every circumstance bearing on this lesson is depicted. This, however,
does not detract the least from the truth and genuineness of the facts which, by the
plan of Providence, seem to have taken place for this very purpose. The demand of
the king that the magicians should tell him his dream, which he himself had forgotten,
and that failing to do so they should be put to death; <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>the decree commanding his subjects to worship the idol and to pray to him, and other
foolish royal acts, almost incredible to us, are strange indeed, but would appear
less strange if all the records of the acts of Eastern tyrants had been preserved.
It has been contended that the history of the Syrian wars with Egypt, and the suffering
of the Jews through the Syrian invasion, is given in such detail as could only be
done by a contemporary. But apart from the fact that a careful study of the visions
of Daniel will convince us that we have here only a faint outline of the Syrian wars
and not a detailed description, it must not be forgotten that the author only reproduces
what was shown to him by the Omniscient concerning the most important event in the
history of the nation—the preservation of the holy religion through the firmness and
the courage of a few faithful servants of God. The fulfilment of the portion of the
vision which referred to the period of the Maccabees is a guarantee for the fulfilment
of the prophecies yet unrealised.
</p>
<p>In like manner have the authenticity and the integrity of other Biblical books been
rejected; the method and the arguments are the same; they are based on a misunderstanding
of the true essence of prophecy and inspiration, and originate in a want of belief
in the Omniscience and Omnipotence of the Divine Being.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9"><i>On the Ninth Principle</i>, p. 139.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9.1">In the Pentateuch there is not the slightest indication that the laws revealed on
Sinai might be superseded by a future Revelation. On the contrary, we meet repeatedly
with the phrases, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקת עולם‎</span>, “an everlasting statute,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לדרות עולם‎</span>, “for everlasting generations,” and similar expressions, which clearly show the intention
of Him who gave the laws that these should last for ever. The Israelites were told
that <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>Prophets would be sent to them, and that they must listen to the Prophets and obey
them, but at the same time they were commanded to put to death a prophet who would
attempt “to turn them aside from the way which the Lord commanded them to walk therein”
(Deut. xiii. 6). Besides, the Prophets never speak of a new Revelation, which would
supersede the Torah. When Jeremiah prophesies about a <i>new covenant</i>, the context teaches the reader what is meant by the “new covenant.” He speaks of
the future and final restoration of Israel as follows: “Behold, days will come, saith
the Lord, when I shall make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house
of Judah. Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I
took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, because they broke
my covenant, and I rejected them, saith the Lord. But this is the covenant which I
shall make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, when I set my
Law among them and write it upon their heart: both I shall be to them a God, and they
shall be to me a people” (Jer. xxxi. 31–33). The Law is not to be altered, but it
will dwell more firmly in the heart of Israel; the deliverance from Egypt was soon
forgotten, but the future deliverance will plant the fear and love of God—here called
the Law of God—in the hearts of the people in such a manner that it will take a deep
root and will not be plucked out of it again. There occur, however, in Talmud and
Midrash sayings which seem to imply a future alteration of the Law; <i>e.g.</i>, “In future all prayers will cease except that of thanksgiving: in future all sacrifices
will cease except that of thanks-offering” (Midrash on Ps. c.). In these sayings their
authors simply intended to emphasise the duty of thanksgiving; even in the state of
physical and moral perfection, when there will be a perfect absence of trouble and
fear and a perfect immunity of sin, so that there will be nothing to be prayed <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>for, nothing to be atoned for through sacrifice, the duty of offering prayers and
sacrifices of thanksgiving will still remain in full force. Another saying of this
kind is: “If all festivals were to cease, Purim will never be forgotten” (Piyyut for
Sabbath Zachor); that is, even if other festivals should be neglected, Purim is so
much liked that it will never be forgotten by the Jews. In Talmud Jerus. Megillah
(i. 7) we read: “The reading from the Prophets and the Hagiographa may at some future
time be discontinued, but the reading of the Pentateuch will never be abolished.”
The idea expressed by this dictum is, that the warnings or consolations or prayers
may become superfluous by the changed condition of the future, but the laws and statutes
of the Pentateuch will always remain in force.
</p>
<p>In sayings of this kind the time to which they are meant to apply is not defined.
“The future” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לעתיד לבא‎</span>) may mean the time of Messiah, or else the time of the Resurrection, or what we are
used to call “the future life.” As in the above quotation, the authors aimed at inculcating
some moral lesson for the present state of things, and not at describing the results
of philosophical speculation with regard to remote times. A new revelation, or the
abrogation of the Law or part of it, is nowhere mentioned.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is emphasised in the Talmud that the Torah has been given to Israel
in its entirety, and nothing has been reserved for a second revelation. “The Law is
not any longer in heaven,” it is entirely in the hands of man. The only authority
recognised in the interpretation of the Law was that based on knowledge, tradition,
and common sense. Authority claimed for this purpose on the ground of supernatural
privilege, prophecy, <i>bath-kol</i> or miracle, was not recognised (Babyl. Talm. Baba Metsia, 59<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9.3">Maimonides (Mishneh torah, Hilchoth Yesode ha-torah ix.) says on this principle as
follows:—“It has been distinctly stated in the Torah that its precepts remain in <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>force for ever without change, diminution, or addition. Comp. ‘The word which I command
you that you must keep to do, thou shalt not add ought unto it nor take ought away
from it’ (Deut. xiii. i); ‘That which has been revealed for us and for our children
for ever is to do all the words of this Law’ (<i>Ibid.</i> xxix. 28). Hence it follows that we are bound for ever to do according to the words
of the Torah. It is further said, ‘An everlasting statute for all your generations’
(Exod. xii. 14, 17, <i>et passim</i>); ‘It is not in heaven’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6324src" href="#xd32e6324">24</a> (Deut. xxx. 12). Hence we see that a prophet cannot reveal any new law. If, therefore,
any man, whether an Israelite or a non-Israelite, should rise, perform signs and miracles,
and say that the Lord sent him to add one precept or to abolish one of the Divine
precepts, or to interpret a precept in a way different from what has been handed down
to us from Moses, or assert that the precepts which were given to the Israelites had
only temporary force and were not permanent laws: such a man is a false prophet, because
he contradicts the prophecy of Moses. The mission of the Prophets after Moses is to
exhort the people to obey the Law of Moses, and not to make a new religion.”—Comp.
“The Guide,” II. xxxix.; and Saadiah, <i>Emunoth ve-deoth</i>, III. chap. vii. to x.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9.4">Rabbi Jehudah ha-Levi, in the book <i>Cuzari</i>, seems to have a different view. He likewise believes in the permanent character
of the Torah, but he modifies his view in accordance with his interpretation of the
words, “And thou shalt do according to the word which they—viz., the priests and the
judge that shall be in those days—will tell thee from that place which the Lord shall
choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they will teach thee” (Deut.
xvii. 9, 10). According to his view, these words <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>imply that from time to time prophets or inspired men, or the highest authority of
the nation, whilst the <i>Shechinah</i> was still filling the Temple, issued laws and orders, which had legal force, and
all were bound to obey them. But since the destruction of the Temple there has not
been any man or any court that had the authority to make new permanent laws. According
to Maimonides, however, there were no additions made to the Torah; the Rabbinical
laws are either temporary regulations or served as a means of ensuring the strict
observance of the Torah.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9.5">Albo, in criticising the principles of faith as laid down by Maimonides, objects also
to the Ninth Principle, and contends that it is not fundamental, since the belief
in the Divine origin of the Law does not necessarily imply the belief in its eternity.
But although the possibility of a second revelation superseding the first is admitted
in principle or theory, it does not follow that such revelation has in reality been
made. If any person asserts that he is sent by God to repeal the old laws or to alter
them, he must prove his Divine mission before he can be believed. We are fully convinced
of the Divine mission of Moses, and our conviction of the Divine mission of the new
prophet must at least be equally strong. The Divine character of the mission of Moses
was revealed to the Israelites by God Himself; and only such direct revelation could
satisfy us as to the trustworthiness of the new prophet (Ikkarim III. xix.).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.9.6">R. Abraham ben David, in his book <i>Emunah-ramah</i>, finds in various passages of the Bible indications that the Torah was to remain
in force permanently. Thus Isaiah and Zechariah, speaking of the remote future, refer
respectively to the celebration of Sabbath and New-moon, and to the celebration of
Sukkoth. Again, in refuting the claims of Christians on behalf of Jesus, and of Mohammedans
on behalf of Mohammed, to a Divine mission to substitute a new covenant <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>for the old one, Rabbi Abraham argues thus: “The divinity of the old covenant, or
the Torah, has been admitted by both Jesus and Mohammed; we need not prove it. But
the Divine authority asserted by them for its abrogation or change is not admitted
by us; it must be proved; and since no proof has been given, it must be rejected”
(Fifth Principle, chap. ii.).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.10"><i>On the Tenth Principle</i>, p. 148.
</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this principle is exceptionally supported by a Biblical verse.
The same may be noticed in the book <i>Cuzari</i> (V. xviii.), in the enumeration of the principles of faith according to the methods
of Mohammedan Theologians (<i>Medabberim</i>); the principle of God’s Omniscience is supported by a Biblical verse, only with
this difference, that in the <i>Cuzari</i> it is not exactly the principle of God’s Omniscience, but its proof derived from
the Creation, that is supported by a quotation from Ps. xciv. The reason of the anomaly
is this: Some of the opponents of this principle contend that it would be derogatory
to the greatness of God if He were to take notice of the doings of each individual
being. To this the reply is given: The Psalmist, who was far from saying anything
derogatory of God, declared that God knows the deeds and the thoughts of each individual.
</p>
<p>The problem how to reconcile God’s Prescience and Omniscience with man’s Free-will
has of course engaged the attention of all Jewish theologians and philosophers, and,
though in different ways and words, they all assume that God’s knowledge of a thing
is by no means the <i>cause</i> of its existence. (See <i>Cuzari</i>, V. xx.; “Guide,” III. xx.; Saadiah, <i>Emunoth</i>, II. chap, ix.)
</p>
<p>Perhaps a reconciliation is not necessary at all, there being no conflict. We should
not call it a defect in God if His Omniscience were restricted to things knowable;
a prescience <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>of things to be determined by man’s free-will is contradictory in itself, and illogical,
and to say that God would not be omniscient if He did not know them, is as absurd
as to say that God would not be omnipotent if He could not make twice two to be three.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.11"><i>On the Eleventh Principle</i>, p. 150.
</p>
<p>The subject of this creed has been the main thought of the lesson preached by the
prophets, of the hymns sung by the psalmists, and of the narratives written by the
sacred chroniclers, as has been illustrated above (p. 155) by Biblical quotations.
To these may be added (1.) the song <i>haazinu</i>, the professed object of which was to remind the Israelites of God’s Justice whenever
evil should befall them. The words which form the basis of the song, viz., “The Rock,
perfect is his work,” &amp;c. (Deut. xxxii. 4), are also at present recited at funeral
rites, as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדוק הדין‎</span>, an expression of our firm belief in God’s Justice. (2.) The prophet who laments
over the fall of Jerusalem declares: “Out of the mouth of the Most High do not come
forth the evil things and the good (<i>i.e.</i>, man causes them by his evil or good deeds, which are the result of his own free
will and not of the Will of God). Why should man complain (of what has befallen him),
being master over his sins?” (Lam. iii. 38, 39).
</p>
<p>In the Talmud the doctrine of God’s Justice is expressed thus: “Thy employer is trustworthy,
that he will pay thee the reward of thy deeds” (Aboth ii. 21). “The shop is open,
and the merchant gives on credit, and all who like may come and borrow; but the collectors
go constantly about, and exact payment whether the debtor is willing to pay or not,
for they have something to rely upon, and the judgment is a just judgment; and everything
is prepared for a banquet” (Aboth iii. 20). “God does not withhold ought of the desert
of any creature” (Pesachim, 118<i>a</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is, however, emphatically declared in the Talmud that the reward of good deeds
is given to the righteous in the future life, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הבא‎</span>, “The reward for obedience to the Divine commandments is not to be expected in this
world” (Kiddushin, 39<i>b</i>). “The Law says with reference to the Divine precepts, ‘Which I command thee <i>this day</i> to do them;’ hence we infer that their performance is to take place <i>this day</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, in this life, but their reward will be received in the future life” (Abodah-zarah,
3a).
</p>
<p>“Rabbi Elazar ha-kappar used to say, ‘Those that have been born will die; those that
have died will come to life again; those that have come to life again will be judged.’
He said so in order that he himself might bear in mind, and tell others, and that
it might become generally known, that God, who has formed and created man’s heart
and understands all his doings, is the Judge, the Witness, and the Prosecutor; He
before whom there is no wrong, no forgetfulness, no partiality, and no bribery, will
one day judge. Let thy imagination not persuade thee that the grave is a refuge for
thee. For without thy consent hast thou been born, and without thy consent wilt thou
die, and without thy consent thou art brought to life again to account for thy deeds
before the King of kings, blessed be He” (Aboth iv. 22).
</p>
<p>The immediate enjoyment of the reward is, however, not excluded. We read in the Law,
“Do this and thy days will be long;” and the Mishnah teaches, “These are the good
acts, the fruit of which man enjoys in this life, whilst the full reward awaits him
in the world to come: honouring father and mother, the practice of charity, peace-making
between man and man, and above all the study of the Law” (Mishnah, Peah. i. 1).
</p>
<p>The faithful Israelite is not discouraged at the sight of the successes of the wicked;
on the contrary, he believes: “If to those who break the Divine laws such kindness
is shown <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>by God, what must be His goodness to those who obey Him!” (Midrash Yalkut on Isaiah
viii. 1). As regards the troubles of the good, our Sages teach that the good will
receive their reward “in proportion to their suffering.” Yet pious men do not seek
trouble and pain merely for the prospect of future compensation; on the contrary,
they avail themselves of every possible means to secure relief, and would even renounce
in their agony all compensation in the future world, in order to secure release from
pain in the present (Babyl. Talm. Berachoth, 5<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>As the life of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden was free from care and trouble,
and such a life was the ideal of human hopes and wishes, the Garden-Eden, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גן עדן‎</span> (lit., “the garden of pleasure”), became the symbol of man’s happiness in its perfection,
such as will fall to the share of the good and the righteous. On the other hand, the
valley of Hinnom, near Jerusalem, was a place of horror and disgust; a place where
at one time children were burnt to Moloch, and where later the refuse of the city
was cast. Dwelling in the valley of Hinnom (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גיהנום‎</span>) became the symbol of the punishment to be inflicted on the wicked. Gan-eden or Paradise,
and Gehinnom or Hell, are thus mere figures to express our idea of the existence of
a future retribution, and must not be taken literally as names of certain places.
</p>
<p>The detailed descriptions of Paradise and hell as given in books both profane and
religious are nothing but the offspring of man’s imagination.
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.11.1">The question has been asked, How long shall the punishment of the wicked last? Will
it be eternal? and if so, is it compatible with God’s goodness? This and similar questions
do not concern us in the least. Our task is to do what the Lord has commanded us to
do, and to trust, as regards the future, in Him, who knows best to combine goodness
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>justice. We must here bear in mind that “God’s thoughts are not ours.”
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.11.2">Equally ignorant are we as to the cause of the suffering and of the death of each
individual; but of this we are certain, if death is punishment, that every one dies
for his own sin. This theory is so frequently repeated in the Bible that it is surprising
how the theory of Vicarious Death and Vicarious Atonement could be considered as harmonising
with the teaching of the Bible. We are taught that God visits the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation; but at the
same time we are told that the children are only punished if they repeat the sins
of their fathers, and even then only for their own sins (comp. p. 251). It has been
asserted that Isaiah in chap. liii. assumes the principle of vicarious atonement.
That this is not the case we can easily see if we turn from the Anglican Version to
the original Hebrew, and translate it literally and in accordance with the context.
Isaiah, in describing the future glory of the servant of the Lord (= Israel), tells
us what those people who oppress Israel will then feel, and how they will give expression
to their feeling of shame and regret, saying, “Surely he hath borne griefs caused
by us, and carried sorrows caused by us: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
God, and afflicted. But he was wounded through our transgressions, bruised through
our iniquities” (comp. Family Bible, Anglican Version, revised by M. Friedländer).
Sin-offerings were brought, but not as a vicarious atonement, although the sinner
might well have felt that he himself deserved the treatment endured by the sacrifice.
The sin-offering could not have been a vicarious atonement, as it was not offered
when the sin was committed knowingly. Maimonides explains the various laws concerning
sin-offering as based on the principle that the sacrifices serve as the means of reminding
us more vividly <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>of our sins, and of their evil consequences (The Guide, III. xlvi.; comp. Mic. vi.
6–8).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.12"><i>On the Twelfth Principle</i>, p. 155.
</p>
<p>A belief in Messiah, although not directly taught, is assumed in the Mishnah as existing;
and the days of Messiah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ימות המשיח‎</span>) are spoken of as an event that admits of no doubt (comp. Mishnah Berachoth, i. 5).
That this belief was in reality taught by the religious heads of the Jewish community
is clearly shown by the introduction into the <i>Amidah</i> of a prayer<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6435src" href="#xd32e6435">25</a> for the speedy appearance of Messiah.
</p>
<p>The belief in the coming of Messiah in some future time has been, like the belief
in the Unity of God, the source of vexatious disputations between Jews and non-Jews.
Mohammedans and Christians tried by all means in their power to convince the Jews
that the Anointed whose advent was prophesied by the Prophets had already appeared,
the former pointing to Mohammed, the latter to Jesus, as the person realising those
predictions. The Biblical passages adduced as evidence prove nothing of the kind.
<i>E.g.</i>, the three names, Sinai, Seir, and Paran, in Deut. xxxiii. 2, were interpreted by
Mohammedans to refer to three revelations through Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed; and
Mohammed being mentioned last, his revelation was to be the final one. It is not necessary
to contradict such reasoning; one need only read the text in order to see the absurdity
of the argument. Christians quoted passages from Isaiah which had no reference whatever
to Messiah in evidence of the Messianity of Jesus. Children born in the days of Isaiah
(vii. 14; viii. 18), whose names had reference to good or evil events of the time,
were wrongly interpreted as referring to the birth of Jesus; the sufferings and final
relief of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>servant of the Lord, that is, Israel (chaps. lii. and liii.), were applied to Jesus;
the Psalmist who sings of victories which God will grant to David (cx.) is made to
declare the divinity of Jesus.
</p>
<p>Commentators and philosophers have taken notice of these arguments and refuted them.
Of the many works on these topics a few may be named: “Nitsachon” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נצחון‎</span>), by <span class="corr" id="xd32e6451" title="Source: Lippman">Lipmann</span> Mühlhausen (1400), “Strengthening of Faith” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזוק אמונה‎</span>), by Isaak ben Abraham Troki (1594), “<span lang="la">Vindiciæ Judæorum</span>,” by Manasseh ben Israel (1650).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.12.1">In refuting arguments brought by Christians and Mohammedans against Jews and Judaism,
and rejecting the Messianic claims of Jesus and Mohammed, Jews are ready to acknowledge
the good work done by the religions founded by these men, Christians and Mohammedans,
in combating idolatry and spreading civilisation. Maimonides says as follows:—“The
King Messiah will in some future time come, restore the kingdom of David to its former
power, build the Temple, bring together the scattered of Israel, and all the ancient
laws will again be in force: sacrifices will be offered, and years of release and
Jubilees will be kept as prescribed in the Law. Whoever does not believe in him, or
does not hope for his coming, shows a want of faith not only in the Prophets, but
also in the Law; for the Law testifies concerning him in the words: ‘And the Lord
thy God will again bring back thy captivity, show mercy to thee, and again gather
thee, &amp;c. If thy outcasts be at the end of the heavens, thence will the Lord gather
thee,’ &amp;c, ‘and the Lord will bring thee,’ &amp;c. (Deut. xxx. 3–5), &amp;c.
</p>
<p>“You must not imagine that Messiah must prove his Messianity by signs and miracles,
doing something unexpected, bringing the dead to life, or similar things, &amp;c. The
principal thing is this: the statutes and precepts of our Torah remain for ever, and
nothing can be added to them nor ought <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>taken from them. If, therefore, a descendant of David earnestly studies the Law, observes,
like David his father, what the Law, both the written and the oral, enjoins, causes
all Israelites to act similarly, exhorts those who are lax in the performance of the
commandments, and fights the wars of the Lord: he may possibly be Messiah. If he succeeds,
builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the outcasts of Israel, he is certainly
Messiah; and if he does not succeed, or is killed in war, it is certain that he is
not the Messiah promised in the Law; he is like all the noble and good kings of the
House of David who have died; and the Almighty only caused him to rise in order to
try us thereby, as it is said, ‘And of the wise some will stumble, and through them
the people will be tested, purified, and made white, till the time of the end comes;
for there is yet a vision for an appointed time’ (Dan. xi. 35). Also Jesus, the Nazarene,
who imagined that he would be Messiah, and was killed through the court of law, is
alluded to in the Book of Daniel, as it is said, ‘And the sons of the transgressors
among thy people will rise, in order to establish a vision, and will stumble’ (<i>ibid.</i> xi. 14). Can there be a greater stumbling than this? All the prophets said that Messiah
will be a redeemer and a saviour to the Israelites, will bring together their outcasts,
and will strengthen their obedience to the Divine precepts, but he (Jesus) caused
destruction by the sword to Israel, the dispersion of those left, and their humiliation;
he changed the Law, and misled many people to worship a being beside God. But the
thoughts of the Creator of the universe cannot be understood by any human being, for
the ways of men are not His ways, nor their thoughts His thoughts; for all the events
connected with Jesus and with Mohammed, that rose after him, served only to pave the
way for the King Messiah, who will reform all mankind and lead them to the unanimous
service of God, as it is said, ‘For <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that all may call by the name of
God, and serve him unanimously’ (Zeph. iii. 9). How can this be done? Almost all people
have through them—Jesus and Mohammed—become acquainted with the idea of Messiah, with
the words of the Torah and the Divine precepts. Through them the knowledge of the
Bible spread even unto the remotest islands and unto many nations ‘uncircumcised’
in heart and uncircumcised in flesh. They seek to justify their disobedience to the
precepts of the Torah; some of them say that these precepts are Divine, but are not
in force at present, and were never intended to be permanent laws; others maintain
that they must not be taken literally, as they are mere symbols, the meaning of which
has already been explained by Messiah. But when the true King Messiah will rise, he
will prosper, be high and exalted; all will then at once know that it was falsehood
what their fathers have inherited, and that their prophets and their teachers have
misled them.
</p>
<p>“Do not imagine that in the days of Messiah the course of Nature will be altered in
any way, or that any new creation will take place. When Isaiah said, ‘The wolf will
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid,’ he merely employed
allegorical and figurative speech; and he meant to say that the Israelite will dwell
in safety together with his enemy, who has been as cruel to him as wolves and leopards,
&amp;c.; all will join the true religion; they will not rob, nor commit any violence,
&amp;c., and in the days of Messiah the meaning of the allegories will be clearly known.
</p>
<p>“Our Sages said that there will be no other difference between the present time and
the days of Messiah but the independence of the people of Israel.
</p>
<p>“It appears from the literal meaning of the prophecies that the Messianic period will
be preceded by the war of Gog and <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>Magog, and that before the war a prophet will appear to guide the Israelites, and
to direct their hearts to repentance. Comp. ‘Behold, I will send you Elijah,’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6476src" href="#xd32e6476">26</a> &amp;c. (Mal. iii. 23). Elijah will not come to declare unclean that which is clean,
or clean that which is unclean; nor to disqualify persons who are believed to be qualified
for joining the congregation of the Lord, or to qualify persons who are believed to
be disqualified; but he will come to establish peace on earth, as it is said, ‘He
shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6479src" href="#xd32e6479">27</a> (<i>Ibid.</i> 24).
</p>
<p>“Some of our Sages believe that Elijah will come before Messiah, but of all these
and similar things no man knows how they will come to pass; they are unexplained in
the Prophets, and our Sages have no tradition about them; they only adopt what they
believe to be the meaning of the Biblical passages which refer to this subject. Hence
the difference of opinion. At all events, the order and the detail of these events
do not form an essential portion of our creed; we must not take too much notice of
Agadoth and Midrashim speaking on these and similar themes. We must not attribute
great importance to them, for they do not lead to the fear or the love of God. We
must also abstain from calculating the time of the coming of Messiah, &amp;c. All we have
to do is to believe in the coming of Messiah, to wait and hope.
</p>
<p>“It is not because they desired to have dominion over all lands and nations, and be
honoured by all people, or because they desired to have plenty to eat and drink, and
other pleasures, that the wise men and the prophets longed for the Messianic days,
but because they would then be at leisure to study the Law and its teaching without
being <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>interrupted by any oppressor, and would thus make themselves worthy of the life in
the world to come (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הבא‎</span>).
</p>
<p>“There will not be in those days any famine, war, jealousy, or quarrel, because the
good things will be in plenty, and even luxuries will be found everywhere; all will
only busy themselves with trying to know the Lord. Therefore the Israelites will be
great sages, knowing things which are at present hidden; they will obtain a knowledge
of their Creator as far as is possible by human understanding; ‘For the earth is full
with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters that cover the sea’ ” (Maim., Mishneh-torah
xiv.; Hilchoth Melachim xi.–xii.).
</p>
<p>The war of Gog and Magog against the Holy Land referred to by Maimonides is described
by the prophet Ezekiel (chaps. xxxviii., xxxix.) as preceding the complete restoration
of Israel. Saadiah has a different view of this war. The punishment of Israel in exile
is to come to an end at a fixed time, or as soon as the Israelites by earnest and
thorough repentance show themselves worthy of Divine grace. In that case no war of
Gog and Magog will be waged against them. But if the Israelites should allow the approach
of the time fixed for the redemption without having given signs of repentance and
improvement, great troubles will be brought upon them, which will forcibly remind
them of the necessity of returning to God; they will come together under a leader,
Messiah ben Joseph, under whose leadership they will fight against their enemies,
but will be beaten, and Messiah ben Joseph himself will be killed. Then Messiah ben
David will appear, and with him the period of glory, of permanent peace and prosperity,
and of the worship of the One God by all nations. The idea of a double Messiah, a
warlike and a peaceful, an unsuccessful and a successful, is not expressed in any
of the prophecies in the Bible, and seems to be of a later origin. Maimonides is <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>silent about Messiah ben Joseph; so also Albo in <i>Ikkarim</i>, and Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi in the book <i>Cuzari</i>. Albo discusses the question about Messiah in chap. xlii. of the fourth section of
<i>Ikkarim</i>. He refutes the opinion of those who maintain that the Messianic prophecies refer
to the reign of Hezekiah or to the restoration of Israel under Zerubbabel and Ezra.
The condition of the Israelites in the reign of Hezekiah did not resemble the state
of prosperity and glory and universal peace as depicted in the Messianic prophecies;
the fulfilment of these prophecies is still hoped for, and our hope is founded on
our belief in the truthfulness of the Word of God. (Comp. Saadiah, Em. ve-deoth, VIII.
iii.).
</p>
<p id="ch1.n.13"><i>On the Thirteenth Principle</i>, p. 16
</p>
<p>The belief in the Resurrection of the Dead has been formulated in the Mishnah (Sanhedrin
x. i) as an essential creed: “He who says that the belief in the Resurrection of the
Dead is not implied in the Law has no portion in the world to come.” There is no doubt
that the Almighty has the power to give fresh life to the body in which life has been
extinct. We set no limits to the Omnipotence of God. But it is different if we ask
whether it is the Will of God to give new life to the dust and ashes of the dead,
and to restore the soul to the dead body in which it has dwelt before. Maimonides
substitutes the Immortality of the Soul for the Resurrection of the Dead, and has
been vehemently attacked by those who had a different opinion. He defended his view
in an essay called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מאמר תחיית המתים‎</span>, “On the Resurrection of the Dead,” in which he attempts to prove that the Agadoth
and Midrashim in depicting the future life employed figurative language, but in reality
meant only a spiritual life, without any material enjoyment.
</p>
<p>Saadiah defends the literal interpretation of “Resurrection <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>of the Dead” (<i>Emunoth ve-deoth</i>, VII.), and believes that the event will take place at the time of the final redemption
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גאולה אחרונה‎</span>). Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi, in <i>Cuzari</i>, though mentioning this principle, seems to understand it as identical with the Immortality
of the Soul. The king, who was at first surprised at the scarcity of references to
the future life in our prayers, confessed his complete satisfaction, after having
heard the exposition of our prayers by the Jewish scholar. “I see,” he says, “that
I was in error; those who pray to have the Divine light vouchsafed to them during
lifetime, who long to see it with their own eyes, and to attain to the degree of prophecy,
they certainly seek something better even than the future life, and they who attain
it may be sure that they will also enjoy the blessing of the future life; for if the
soul of a man, troubled by the wants of the body, is nevertheless cleaving to the
Divine glory, how much more may this be the case after the soul has left this body!”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The king, in Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi’s Cuzari, anxious to lead a good and religious
life, was told by an angel who appeared to him in a dream that his heart was good,
but his deeds were not acceptable. The purity and goodness of our heart certainly
ennobles our deeds and gives them the stamp of sincerity and holiness, though they
may not be marked by absolute perfection. But an inner voice, our conscience, does
not allow us to be content with the goodness of the heart; we feel the necessity of
seeking also perfection of words and deeds. We wish not only our heart but also our
entire self to be good, so that our inner life and outer life, our feeling and thinking,
our speaking and doing, may combine into one harmonious whole, which comes as near
perfection as possible.
</p>
<p>It has been shown above that one of the principles of faith which we confess is our
belief in the Divine origin of the Torah, and in the obligatory character of its precepts.
When we pray to God to make us understand the Torah we are not content with the mere
knowledge of the words of the Law; we also seek God’s assistance to enable us “to
obey, to observe, and to <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>perform” all that He has commanded us. Man’s nature is not the same in all individuals;
one person finds special delight in the performance of this duty, another in the performance
of that. Every one likes to devote his energies to that work for which he considers
himself best qualified, and which promises to yield the best fruit. But this individual
liking or aptitude must not mislead us into thinking that the Law is divided into
important and unimportant precepts. So far as they represent the Will of the Almighty
they are all alike, and equally demand our attention and our obedience. Thus the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת עול שמים‎</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="n234.1src" href="#n234.1">1</a> our unconditional submission to the Will of the Almighty as our King, is followed
in our Service by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת עול מצות‎</span>,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="xd32e6550src" href="#n234.1">1</a> the acknowledgment of the binding force of His precepts.
</p>
<p>There are persons who question the wisdom and usefulness of the precepts; they call
it legalism, and are opposed to the tendency of subjecting every act of ours to the
control of the Law. They argue that legalism tends to weaken our regard for the Law,
and trains hypocrites rather than true servants of the Lord. It is a bold assertion,
but one that rests on imagination and prejudice. Is it possible that such a constant
reminder of God’s presence as the Divine precepts supply should not have a beneficent
influence over us, by making us feel encouraged by His presence when we are engaged
in a good cause, and discouraged when we are about to do wrong? If persons are found
who are <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>devout worshippers at one time and criminals at another, it only shows human weakness
in the moment of trial in spite of good resolves and genuine devotion; and were it
not for the effect of such devotion, the number of crimes would probably be far greater.
</p>
<p>A truly pious man will never imagine that he may freely transgress one set of the
precepts, if he strictly obeys another set; that he may, <i>e.g.</i>, wrong his neighbour, and compensate for his sins by regular attendance at the place
of worship, or by a strict observance of the dietary laws, or the laws of Sabbath
and Festivals; or that he may freely break the latter, if only he is honest, just,
and charitable. The precepts have all the same Divine origin; the all-wise and all-kind
God, who has commanded us to walk in the way of justice and righteousness, has also
ordained the Sabbath, given the dietary laws, and established the sacrificial service.
He who selects some of the precepts and rejects the rest substitutes his own authority
for that of the Almighty, and places his own wisdom above the wisdom of Him who gave
us the Law.
</p>
<p>“Be as zealous in the performance of an unimportant precept as of an important one,”
is one of the maxims taught in the “Sayings of the Fathers.” A difference between
precept and precept is here admitted, but only in so far as they seem to us more or
less important, with regard to the good which their observance produces or the evil
which is caused by their neglect. In case of a conflict of two duties we give the
preference to that which seems to us more important. In times of religious persecution
the question frequently arose how far resistance was necessary, and how far religious
practice might <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>yield to physical force. The rule has been laid down, that when our life is threatened
we may transgress any precept; but we must not allow ourselves, under any circumstances,
to be forced to idolatry, murder, or adultery (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבודה זרה גלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים‎</span>); we must prefer death to committing any of these sins. But in times of trouble and
persecution the spirit of resistance is as a rule too strong to be kept within the
strict lines of demarcation, and life is willingly and heroically sacrificed for any
religious duty. This is not surprising, for every religious act which is chosen by
the enemy as a test to prove the faithfulness or the faithlessness of the persecuted
sect to its own religion, receives thereby the stamp of great importance.
</p>
<p>Similar questions are also asked in times of peace, when some of our brethren reject
the authority of the Oral Law, while others refuse even to recognise the authority
of the Written Law, when some set aside the Divine precepts out of convenience, and
others from principle, and still others from ignorance; when some limit their Judaism
to the nominal membership of the Jewish race, and others to a negation of other creeds.
Are all these Jews? Whatever the answer to this question may be from a practical,
political, social, and communal point of view, the fact is that they are Jews. They
may have forfeited certain privileges, they may be disqualified for certain religious
offices, they may be dangerous to the religious peace of our family or community:
they are notwithstanding Jews, and are bound to live in accordance with the Law which
the Almighty has given to the Jews and for the Jews. Our Sages say: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אף על פי שחטא ישראל הוא‎</span>, “Although a man may have sinned, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>is an Israelite still.” No theologian, Rabbi, or teacher, or Beth-din, or Sanhedrin,
has the power of granting absolution, or telling those who break or reject any portion
of the Divine precepts that they are not doing wrong. No human being has the authority
to abrogate laws revealed by God. Why then, some may ask, do prophets and moralists,
the Rabbis of the Talmud not excluded, single out ethical principles for special recommendation
to their fellow-men, generally observing silence about the rest of the Divine commands?
The answer is simple. The ethical principles and the Divine commandments embodying
them are different in kind from the rest of the commandments. The latter are distinct,
well defined, and the punishment for their transgression is fixed; they are unchangeable,
and not capable of expansion.
</p>
<p>The dietary laws, <i>e.g.</i>, are exactly the same now as they were in the days of Moses. So also the laws concerning
Sabbath. What was then prohibited by the Sabbath is prohibited still. The ethical
principles, however, are capable of development, and the moral standard rises with
the progress of civilisation. Hence the constant dissatisfaction of prophets, preachers,
and teachers with the moral principles of their followers. They have a higher standard
of morality, and strive to raise the moral consciousness of their generations to their
own height.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, no wonder that the prophet Isaiah exhorts his brethren: “Wash you,
make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do
evil: learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow” (i. 16, 17). “He that walketh righteously, <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his
hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth
his eyes from looking upon evil, he shall dwell on high,” &amp;c. (<i>Ibid.</i> xxxiii. 15, 16). In the same sense the virtuous man is described by all prophets;
also in Ps. xv. and Ps. xxiv.
</p>
<p>R. Akiba says: “ ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself’ (Lev. xix. 18) is an important
principle in the Torah,” but at the same time he shows what importance he ascribes
to all other principles and precepts of the Law by most carefully examining the details
of every one of them alike. The great Hillel told the Gentile who desired to become
a Jew: “ ‘Do not to thy neighbour what is hateful to you;’ this is our whole religion;”
but that he did not ignore the remainder of the Torah, or consider it as not essential,
is proved by the additional words: “The rest is its explanation; go and learn” (<i>Babyl. Talmud</i>, <i>Sabbath</i>, 31<i>a</i>). Hillel only gave the proselyte a lesson which would lead him to obey all the words
of the Almighty.
</p>
<p>Rabbi Simlai (Yalkut on Micah vi. 8) said: “Six hundred and thirteen commandments
were given to Moses on Mount Sinai; David reduced them to eleven (Ps. xv.); Isaiah
reduced them to six (xxxiii. 16, 17); Micah (vi. 8) to three; then Isaiah reduced
them again to two (lvi. 1); and Habakkuk to one—Faith (ii. 4).” This Rabbi does certainly
not mean to say that Isaiah cancelled some of the eleven virtues mentioned by David,
or that Habakkuk only demanded Faith, and did not consider it essential that man should
be righteous, truthful, &amp;c. Rabbi Simlai intended only <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>to point out that by training ourselves in the practice of certain virtues, the fulfilment
of all Divine precepts will be greatly facilitated.
</p>
<p>All the commandments of the holy Torah are equally Divine. Laws concerning justice
and humanity, and laws concerning Sabbath and Holydays, are equally introduced by
the declaration, “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying.” The commandments, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,” and “A garment of diverse kinds, of linen and
wool, shall not come upon thee,” stand side by side in the same paragraph. The equality
of all the precepts as the expression of the Will of the Almighty is clearly set forth
in the Law, in the frequent exhortations that the Israelites should obey all the precepts,
whatever their nature may be, whether they be of the class of “statutes” or of “judgments,”
or of any other class of Divine commands. (Comp. Exod. xv. 25, 26; Lev. xxvi. 15,
43; Num. xv. 39, 40; Deut. iv. 1, 5, 8, &amp;c.)
</p>
<p id="ch2.0.2">As to the various terms employed in the Pentateuch to designate the Divine precepts:
words (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דברים‎</span>), commandments (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוות‎</span>), statutes (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקים‎</span>), judgments (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משפטים‎</span>), and laws (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורות‎</span>), they may be considered as synonyms signifying similar things. But even synonyms
are as a rule distinguished from each other by a certain variation in their meaning,
especially when the terms occur in one and the same sentence. A definition of these
terms is not given in the Pentateuch or in the Bible; from the context, however, in
which they occur the following distinction may be drawn:—
</p>
<p><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חק‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקה‎</span>, “statute,” is applied to those laws which are absolute and do not depend on certain
conditions, <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>whilst <i>mishpat</i>, “judgment,” is a law the performance of which varies according to circumstances.
Thus the Paschal sacrifice is called <i>chukkah</i>, and must absolutely be performed, whilst the civil laws concerning slaves, damages,
&amp;c., are <i>mishpatim</i>, because cases of slavery or damages need not occur, and the respective precepts
are then not carried into effect. In a similar manner Jewish theologians divide the
Divine precepts into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות שמעיות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות שכליות‎</span> precepts which our duty of obedience to God makes us perform, and precepts which,
without distinct Divine command, our own reason would impel us to do.—The other terms,
<i>mitsvah</i>, “commandment,” and <i>mishmereth</i>, “charge,” are used in a general sense, the former in reference to the Giver of the
law, and the latter in reference to those to whom it is addressed.
</p>
<p>The division of the precepts into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמעיות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שכליות‎</span> is a vague one, and the line of demarcation will be moved farther to the one side
or the other, according to the judgment exercised by the interpreter. Of greater importance
is the division into positive and negative precepts, commandments, and prohibitions,
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות עשה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות לא תעשה‎</span>. The prohibitions are of two kinds: such as admit of amends being made for their
transgression and such as do not admit: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיש בה קום עשה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שאין בה קום עשה‎</span>.
</p>
<p>The number of the commandments is, according to Rabbi Simlai, 613 (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תר״יג‎</span>), and in some editions of the Pentateuch the number of each commandment has been
noted in the margin. Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, in the introduction to his <i>Mishneh-torah</i>, enumerates the 613 <i>mitsvoth</i>. They are also contained in liturgical <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>compositions, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אזהרות‎</span> “exhortations,” or “precepts,” such as are met with in the Machzor for the Feast
of Weeks.
</p>
<p>Maimonides, in “The Guide” as well as in Mishneh-torah, treats of the precepts of
the Torah under the following fourteen heads: (1) Fundamental principles of our faith;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6678src" href="#xd32e6678">2</a> (2) Divine worship; (3) Sabbath and festivals; (4) Marriages; (5) Forbidden food
and forbidden relations of the sexes; (6) Vows; (7) Agriculture; (8) The Temple and
the regular sacrificial service; (9) Occasional sacrifices; (10) Cleanness and uncleanness;
(11) Compensation for damages; (12) Transfer of property; (13) Contracts; (14) Administration
of the law.
</p>
<p>Another theologian, Rabbenu Jakob, divided the code of laws into four sections: (1)
Divine worship, Sabbath, festivals, and fasts; (2) Things forbidden and things permitted
in satisfying our bodily desires; (3) Marriages; (4) Civil laws.
</p>
<p>The latter work was recast by Rabbi Joseph Caro, <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>and in the new form, with the new title <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, it has become the standard work of Jewish law and life, and its authority has been
recognised and upheld by Jews in the East and the West. Annotations (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגהות‎</span>) were added by Rabbi Moses Isserles, but his opinion, when differing from that of
Rabbi Joseph Caro, was only accepted by the Polish and German Congregations, not by
the Sephardim.
</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph Caro, Rabbenu Jakob, and Maimonides appear, in their respective codes,
not as legislators but as compilers. The Torah and the Talmud were the sources from
which they all drew their laws. But laws, <i>minhagim</i> or customs, and institutions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תקנות‎</span>) of a post-Talmudic date were not neglected. Questions arising in the course of time,
through new and changed conditions of life, are, as a rule, discussed and decided
in notes and commentaries on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. There are also numerous special works on such occasional questions; they are called
“<span lang="la">Responsa</span>” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תשובות‎</span> “Answers,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שאלות ותשובות‎</span> “Questions and Answers”), and the importance attributed to them varies according
to the reputation of the respective authors.
</p>
<p id="ch2.0.3">What is the object of the Divine laws? This is a question that naturally rises in
the minds of those to whom they are addressed. But the question has been anticipated
by Him “who knoweth the thoughts of the sons of man,” and the answer is found in clear
and distinct words in the fountain of living waters, the Torah, that never fails to
satisfy our thirst for truth: “Thou shalt keep his statutes and his commandments which
I command thee this day, <i>that it may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>well with thee and thy children after thee</i>” (Deut. iv. 40). “And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,
but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways and to love him, and to serve
the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul: to keep the commandments
of the Lord and his statutes which I command thee this day, for thy good” (<i>ibid.</i> x. 12, 13). It is for our benefit, for our well-being, that the laws were revealed
to us; they serve to make us good and happy; they train us in the mastery over our
appetites and desires, in the practice of charity and justice, and in the conception
of noble, pure, and lofty ideas, and bring us nearer and nearer in perfection the
Being in whose image and likeness we have been created.
</p>
<p>What share each individual precept has in the attainment of this end we cannot state
with certainty, because in the Torah the reason and purpose of each precept is, with
very few exceptions, withheld from us. In many cases our reflection on the nature
of a special law, or on the context in which it occurs in the Pentateuch, leads to
a discovery of some reason for it. But, whatever reason we may thus discover, we must
not lose sight of the fact that it is we who have found it, we whose knowledge is
imperfect, and that we or others might in future discover a better reason. If we,
<i>e.g.</i>, find that certain dietary laws serve to train us in temperance, and see that the
virtue of temperance is frequently recommended in the Bible, we may well obey these
dietary laws, and strive to be temperate in every respect in accordance with the spirit
we detect in them. It would, however, be a gross error if, believing <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>the training in temperance to be their only object, we assumed that we could neglect
them, and attain the same object by substituting our own insufficient knowledge and
imperfect reason for the Will and Wisdom of the most perfect Being. Moralists, our
teachers and preachers of ancient and modern times, have found in these precepts an
inexhaustible treasure of lessons exhorting to virtue and warning against vice, and
the great variety of inferences thus drawn from the same source proves the error of
those who imagine that their own exposition is the only right one. Whatever reason
we assign to a religious precept, and whatever wholesome lesson we derive from it,
our first duty towards the commandment, and towards Him who commanded it, is strict
and unconditional obedience.
</p>
<p>Maimonides, who may be considered as the representative of the school which seeks
to establish a rational explanation for all precepts, admits that the reason we may
assign to any of the commandments cannot affect their validity and immutability, and
we are bound to obey them, although the supposed reason may be of a local or temporary
character. According to Maimonides, the object of the Law is to promote the well-being
of our body and the well-being of our soul; and every commandment has therefore some
bearing upon one of the following three things: the regulation of our opinions, the
removal of sin, or the teaching of good morals. He does not except the “statutes”
from this rule, but confesses that in a few cases he is unable to show clearly the
relation of the commandment to any of these objects. He also restricts the principle
of rational interpretation to the main element in each commandment, <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>and does not apply it to its details; the latter, as a rule, do not demand an explanation.
He says:—
</p>
<p>“The general object of the Law is twofold: the well-being of the soul and the well-being
of the body” (Guide, iii. 27). “I am prepared to tell you my explanations of all these
commandments (the so-called <i>chukkim</i> or “statutes”), and to assign for them a true reason supported by proof, with the
exception of some minor rules and of a few commandments. I will show that all these
and similar laws must have some bearing upon one of the following three things, viz.,
the regulation of our opinions or the improvement of our social relations, which implies
two things: the removal of wrong-doing and the teaching of good morals” (<i>ibid.</i> xxviii.). “The repeated assertion of our Sages that there are reasons for all commandments,
and the tradition that Solomon knew them, refer to the general purpose of the commandments,
and not to the object of every detail. This being the case, I find it convenient to
divide the six hundred and thirteen precepts into classes; each class to include many
precepts of the same kind. I will first explain the reason of each class of precepts,
and show their common object, and then I shall discuss the individual commandments
and expound their reasons. Only very few will be left unexplained, the reason for
which I have been unable to trace unto this day. I have also been able to comprehend
in some cases even the object of many of the conditions and details of the laws as
far as it can be discovered” (<i>ibid.</i> xxvi.).
</p>
<p>“It is also important to note that the Law does not take into account exceptional
circumstances; it is not based on conditions which rarely occur.” “We must <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>therefore not be surprised when we find that the object of the Law does not fully
appear in every individual case.” “From this consideration it follows that the Law
cannot, like medicine, vary according to the different conditions of persons and times.
Whilst the cure of a person depends on his particular constitution at the particular
time, the Divine guidance contained in the Law must be certain and general, although
it may be effective in some cases and ineffective in others. If the Law depended on
the varying conditions of man, it would be imperfect in its totality, each precept
being left indefinite. For this reason, it would not be right to make the fundamental
principles of the Law dependent on a certain time or a certain place. On the contrary,
the statutes and the judgments must be definite, unconditional, and general, in accordance
with the Divine words: ‘As for the congregation, one ordinance shall be for you and
for the stranger’ (Num. xv. 15). They are intended, as has been stated before, for
all persons and for all times” (<i>ibid.</i> xxxiv.).

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The “Ten Words” are distinguished from all other lessons of the Torah both on account
of their intrinsic value and on account of the extraordinary manner in which they
have been revealed by the Almighty on Mount Sinai. They form the contents of “the
covenant which God made with us” (Deut. v. 3).
</p>
<p>But it must not be forgotten that they are not the only Divine commandments. When,
therefore, Moses repeated them before his brethren in the plain of Moab, he prefaced
it by the exhortation: “Hear, O Israel, <i>the statutes and the judgments</i> which I speak unto you to-day, and learn them and keep them to do them” (<i>ibid.</i> 1); and after he had finished reciting them he reminded the Israelites how they received
the Ten Commandments from the midst of the fire, and how they prayed that further
commandments should be given to them through Moses; adding that the Almighty, in compliance
with their petition, said to him: “Stand thou here with me, and I will tell thee the
whole commandment, both the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them”
(<i>ibid.</i> 28).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“And God spake all these words, saying:”
</p>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>First Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage.</i>”
</p>
<p>The Israelites who now stood round Mount Sinai <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>and heard the voice of God saying, “I am the Lord thy God,” were the same who a very
short time before had been slaves in Egypt; they were delivered from slavery, and
saw their cruel taskmasters perish in the waves of the Red Sea. Pharaoh, the king
of the Egyptians, and his people had believed that they were the masters of the Israelites,
and that they could do with them as they pleased. And Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord,
that I should listen to his voice? I know not the Lord, nor will I let Israel go.”
It has now been shown that Pharaoh and his people were not the true masters; that
there was a higher Being that ruled over all men, over kings and their peoples. After
the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea, they sang with Moses: “This is my God, and
I will praise him, the God of my father, and I will exalt him.” They all felt that
their liberty was not obtained by human strength and skill; that there must be a higher
Being who is All-powerful, All-wise, and All-good; and that it was He who freed them,
and punished the wicked Egyptians by whom they had been kept in slavery. What the
Israelites at first felt in their hearts they were now, when standing round Sinai,
taught by God Himself, in plain, clear, and intelligible words: “I am the Lord thy
God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”
</p>
<p>This is the first commandment; it is only one commandment, but it contains several
important lessons:—
</p>
<p>1. God has shown great kindness to our nation; we Jews must therefore more than other
people show ourselves grateful to Him, love Him as our Deliverer <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>and Benefactor, and do willingly all that He commands us to do.
</p>
<p>2. When we are in trouble we must trust in God, pray to Him, and hope that He will
help us when our fellow-men cannot do so. When they give us up as lost we need not
despair; for the Almighty can help where human wisdom and power are insufficient.
</p>
<p>3. The wicked may for a time succeed in doing wrong, whilst the good and just suffer;
but this does not last for ever. There is a Master above all of us, who in due time
punishes the wicked and saves the good.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Second Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shall have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image,
nor the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them,
nor serve them, for I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them
that hate me; and showing loving-kindness to the thousandth generation of them that
love me and keep my commandments.</i>”
</p>
<p>There are no other gods in existence; it is impossible for us to have other gods.
There is only one God, as we repeatedly declare, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our
God, the Lord is one.” The commandment is nevertheless not superfluous. There have
been whole nations, and there are still people, who, in their ignorance <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>and folly, attribute Divine power to things that have no Divine power, and who give
the name of god to things that are not gods. Such people are called heathens, idolaters,
or idol-worshippers. The second commandment forbids us to do any such thing.
</p>
<p>It was the custom in some countries to worship the king, either during his lifetime
or after his death, as a Divine being; it is still the custom in some countries to
pray to departed saints. All this our holy religion forbids us to do. We must respect
our king, we must honour the memory and the name of good men, but only as human beings,
not as gods; we may not deify them. As to our prophets, our great men, the Patriarchs,
the kings, their names are a pride unto us, their memory a blessing, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכרונם לברכה‎</span>—they are honoured by us as human, mortal beings: they are not worshipped. When we
visit the graves of those near and dear to us, and honour their memory by reflecting
on their virtues, when we revere those holy men who have devoted their lives to the
service of God, or the martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the sanctification
of the Name of God (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדוש השם‎</span>), we do not endow them with Divine attributes, and do not offer up any prayer <i>to</i> them.
</p>
<p>The second commandment, in forbidding all kinds of idolatry, includes the following
prohibitions:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> The worship of sun, moon, stars, animals, human beings, or any part of Nature, as
endowed with Divine power. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> The worship of images representing things that exist in reality or in man’s imagination.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> The worship of angels as Divine beings. They <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>are only messengers of God, and we must not pray to them. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> The belief in evil spirits, demons, devils, and the like, and the fear of them. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5.)</span> The belief in charms, witchcraft, fortune-telling, and similar superstitions. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The words, “<i>For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God</i>,” are to be understood in a figurative sense; we cannot say of God that He is jealous,
in the literal sense of the word. It is only because we call a person jealous who
is anxious that no one else shall enjoy the same right or privilege as he enjoys,
that we <span class="corr" id="xd32e6957" title="Corrected by author from: imply">apply</span> the term “jealous” figuratively to God, because He does not concede Divine worship
and service to any other being. He demands of His worshippers that they serve Him
alone and none besides.
</p>
<p>Those who break this commandment “hate God,” and will surely receive their punishment.
He “visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the
fourth generation.” The bad example set by a man frequently corrupts his children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. In that case they will all receive their punishment,
and there is no excuse for them, that they were misled by the bad example of their
father or their forefathers. A bad example must not be followed, even if it be set
by those whom we love dearly.
</p>
<p>The good example of a man should always be followed, and his good deeds bear good
fruit and are the source of blessing even long after his death. For to those that
love God and keep His commandments God “showeth mercy even to the thousandth generation.”

<h4 class="main"><i>Third Commandment</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold,
him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</i>”
</p>
<p>We pronounce the name of God when we read the Bible, when we pray, when we take an
oath, or when we speak of God’s wisdom, power, and goodness. We take the name of God
in vain when we read the Bible without attention, or pray without devotion, or take
an oath without necessity or contrary to truth. When we utter the name of God we must
bear in mind that it is the name of the most Holy and most Perfect Being that we are
pronouncing; that it is a privilege to us to be allowed and to be able to pronounce
it.
</p>
<p>The more we meditate on the greatness and holiness of God, the more careful should
we be “not to utter the name of God in vain.” We should guard ourselves from falling
into the bad habit of uttering it thoughtlessly to no purpose whatever. Many people
are heard to exclaim every minute, “O God,” or similar phrases. To them the sacredness
of the name is entirely lost, and they are no longer reminded by it of the holiness
of Him who is designated by that name. Still greater is the thoughtlessness of those
who swear by God without any necessity. In swearing by God we call upon God to bear
witness that our words are true. But such a testimony is only required when our statement
is not believed. If we swear before we know whether we are believed or not, we indicate
that, according to our estimate of ourselves, we are not <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>trustworthy, and it has often been observed as a fact that those who swear most are
least to be believed. The worst of all forms of swearing is to swear falsely, that
is, to swear that something is the case without knowing that it is true, or knowing
that it is not true. This is a terrible crime, and is called “the profanation of God’s
name,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלול השם‎</span>.
</p>
<p>There is still another kind of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלול השם‎</span> “profanation of God’s name:” if we Jews who are called by His name, the people of
the Lord, or children of the Lord, bring contempt upon God’s people by disgraceful
conduct, we profane the name of God. We sanctify it by noble and generous deeds; by
leading a pure and blameless life we cause a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדוש השם‎</span> “sanctification of the name of God.”
</p>
<p>The third commandment forbids us—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> To utter the name of God unnecessarily in our common conversation. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> To read the Bible carelessly, or to pray without attention and devotion. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> To swear otherwise than when required by the law to do so, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in courts of law. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> To swear when we are not fully convinced of the truth of our declaration. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The additional sentence, “for he will not hold him guiltless who taketh his name in
vain,” is to remind us that it is against God the Omniscient that we sin in breaking
this commandment. God knows our innermost thoughts, whether we think of what we utter
or not; whether we are convinced of what we declare on oath or not. He will punish
us if we break His commandments, although we may be able <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>to conceal our sins from men and escape condemnation by a human tribunal.

<h4 class="main"><i>Fourth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy
work. But the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,
nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is therein, and rested the seventh day;
wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</i>”
</p>
<p>The Sabbath day, that is, the day of rest, is to be kept holy. In two ways it should
differ from other days; it is to be <i>a day of rest</i> and also <i>a holy day</i>. We keep it as a day of rest by not doing on it any kind of work; we keep it as a
holy day by devoting the greater part of it, since we are free from our ordinary occupation,
to prayer and to reading the Bible.
</p>
<p>We are thankful to God for having commanded us to keep the Sabbath, and give expression
to our feeling of gratitude in our prayers, especially at the beginning and the end
of the Sabbath; thus, on Friday evening, before the meal, we praise God for sanctifying
the Sabbath by a prayer called <i>Kiddush</i>, “sanctification,” and on Sabbath evening, after the close of the Sabbath, we recite
the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e7032" title="Source: Habdalah">Habhdalah</span></i>, in which God is praised for the distinction made between Sabbath and the six week-days.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Israelites were told to remember <i>the</i> Sabbath day; that is, the well-known day of rest, the same day which was instituted
as a day of rest in connection with the manna. On five days they collected one omer
of the manna, on the sixth day two omers for each person; on the seventh day no manna
was collected nor was any found, and the Israelites were commanded to bake and to
cook on the sixth day not only for the sixth day, but also for the seventh, on which
day baking and cooking was not to be done. <i>This same seventh day</i> we are told in the fourth commandment <i>to remember</i> to keep holy, that we should not forget it, or choose another day instead of it.
It is the same seventh day on which God rested after the six days of the Creation,
and which “he blessed and sanctified.”
</p>
<p>It is to be a day of rest not only for ourselves; we must not have work done for us
by our children, or by our servants, or by strangers; even our cattle must rest. After
six days of work we enjoy the blessing of one day’s rest, and are rendered more fit
to work another six days. The harder we work on six days, the more welcome is the
rest of the seventh day to us. When Moses repeated the commandments, he laid special
stress on the rest of the servants, reminding the Israelites that they themselves
had once been slaves, and must therefore recognise the necessity of granting a day
of rest to their servants.
</p>
<p>It is not to be a day of mere idleness. Complete idleness leads to evil thoughts and
evil deeds. Whilst our body rests our mind should be occupied with holy <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>thoughts; we should commune with God, reflect on His works, learn from them the power,
wisdom, and goodness of God, study the Word of God, listen to the instruction of our
teachers and preachers, and altogether try to raise ourselves into a loftier sphere.
</p>
<p>On the day of rest we reflect on the works of God, on the work of Creation which He
completed in six days, and thus by keeping the Sabbath we testify to our belief in
God as the Creator of the Universe. On this account it is that the Creation is referred
to in this commandment as the reason why rest was enjoined for the seventh day. “For
in six days,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>“Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day;” the rest on the seventh day is a blessing
to those who have worked hard during the preceding six days; it is a blessing to those
who spend the Sabbath in a proper manner. “And he hallowed it” by giving man an opportunity
to sanctify himself by more frequent communion with the Most Holy.
</p>
<p>The fourth commandment tells us—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> To remember to keep the same day as Sabbath which has been set apart as such from
the beginning. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> To abstain on that day from all kind of work. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> To devote part of the day to our sanctification. </li>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Fifth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee.</i>”
</p>
<p>The strongest desire that animates a father and a mother is to see their children
good and happy. <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>From the first day of their existence children are guarded by the watchful eyes of
their parents that no evil may befall them. How delighted are father and mother when
they notice the progress of their child in health and strength, in heart and soul!
What an amount of trouble and anxiety parents undergo when they see their child suffering!
No sacrifice is too great for them so long as it ensures the child’s well-being. It
is painful to them to be compelled to deny their child anything, or to rebuke or to
punish it. To this they are impelled only by the anxiety for the welfare of the child.
The mutual affection between parent and child is one which nature has implanted. Without
it the home would be the dwelling of misery and misfortune; with it comfort and happiness
flourish therein. The loving parents have pleasure in whatever they do for the benefit
of the child, and the affectionate child is delighted with the goodness of its parents.
</p>
<p>“<i>Honour thy father and thy mother</i>,” says the Almighty to us. How does a child honour father and mother? In the eyes
of the child father and mother must be the king and the queen of the house, however
small that may be. Every word that comes from their mouth, every desire that they
express, must be regarded as of the greatest importance, and be well remembered by
the child. When the king or the queen speaks, all present stand and listen respectfully;
their words are read by every one with the greatest interest. So it must be with the
words of our parents. Whenever they tell us to do or not to do a thing, obedience
is a blessing to us; disobedience is the chief cause of all misery and trouble. We
feel pleasure and honour in <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>being able to do something that gratifies our parents, and we like to give them at
times some material token of our affection. The best present we can give them is a
good heart, sincere love that prompts us to avoid everything that would grieve them,
and to do everything we can to give them pleasure and to make them happy.
</p>
<p>This is one of the few laws the reward of which is distinctly stated, “That thy days
may be long upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” We can easily understand
the good effect of keeping the fifth commandment. Pleasure and contentment contribute
a good deal to the health and well-being of man, whilst anger, trouble, and dissatisfaction
produce ill-health and weakness. The mutual affection between parent and child is
therefore the cause that the days of both the parents and the children are prolonged,
and the harmony and happiness of the house firmly established. The blessing attending
children’s obedience and love towards their parents does not end here. The whole State
consists of small homes and families, and the greater the well-being of the individual
homes, the greater is the well-being of the whole country. Thus the child by acting
in accordance with this Divine commandment contributes its share towards the prosperity
of the whole country.
</p>
<p>When our parents are not present, we should, out of love towards them, obey those
who take their place, as, <i>e.g.</i>, our elder brothers or sisters, our guardians, and our teachers, since all these
only do what the parents would themselves like to do were the opportunity granted
them.
</p>
<p>We are bound to honour our parents not only so <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>long as we are under their care and live in their house, but also when we have left
our parents’ home, and have become independent. Even when they have become old, weak,
and poor, and we support them, we must not forget the natural relation between parent
and child, and the honour due to parents from their children must still be shown to
them. When they have departed from this life, and we are no longer able to show our
feeling of love and respect in the usual way, we must honour their name and memory,
and hold in respect the wishes and commands which they expressed when still alive.
Death is no bar to true love and sincere affection.
</p>
<p>Thus we obey the fifth commandment—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> By listening respectfully to the words of our parents and obeying what they say.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> By doing that which pleases them, and avoiding that which would displease them. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> By supporting them when they are weak and poor by all our best exertion and with
genuine pleasure. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> By honouring their name and memory after their death. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5.)</span> By being obedient to our elder brothers or sisters, to our guardians, and to our
teachers. </li>
</ul><p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Sixth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not murder.</i>”
</p>
<p>Murder is a most terrible thing; we shudder at the sound of the word, even at the
mere idea of it. We wonder how it is possible that a person should be so wicked, so
cruel, and so unnatural as to take the <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>life of another human being! One who can do such a thing must have lost all human
feeling, and is rather a brute than a being created in the image of God. But, unfortunately,
there have been and there are such wicked people. We read in the Bible that a dispute
arose between the two sons of Adam, and the one, Cain, slew the other, Abel. He repented
it, but he could not restore to his brother the life which he had taken. The severest
punishment is therefore inflicted on those who have committed this crime.
</p>
<p>This commandment and those which follow it have their root in the principle, “<i>Love thy fellow-man as thyself</i>,” applied to the life (sixth commandment), the home (seventh commandment), the property
(eighth commandment), and the honour of our fellow-man (ninth commandment). We wish
to enjoy life as long as possible; it must therefore be our desire to see our fellow-man
enjoy the longest possible life. But we must not rest satisfied with the mere desire.
An earnest desire is followed by acts dictated by it. We must try our utmost, even
as we do with regard to ourselves, to preserve the life of our fellow-man. We have,
<i>e.g.</i>, seen before how by obeying the fifth commandment we lengthen not only our own life,
but also that of our parents, whilst by breaking this law we shorten their life as
well as our own.
</p>
<p>By supporting the poor and nursing the sick we may be the means of increasing a human
life by many days or even years, whilst by neglecting the duty of charity we neglect
to save the life of our fellow-man when it is in our power to do so.—Another instance
of criminal neglect it would be if a person saw another <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>in actual danger of life, and did not try everything in his power to save him.
</p>
<p>Without having directly broken the sixth commandment, without having taken the life
of our neighbour by violence, we may still be guilty of having shortened his life
and caused his untimely death. Talebearers and slanderers, <i>e.g.</i>, often undermine the peace and happiness of an individual, and even of a whole family,
and sow the seed of misery and ruin where well-being and prosperity seemed well established.
</p>
<p>The sixth commandment enjoins that we should respect the life of our fellow-man, and
forbids us therefore—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> To take it by violent means. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> To do anything by which the peace and well-being of our fellow-man might be undermined.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> To neglect anything in our power to save our neighbour from direct or indirect danger
of life. </li>
</ul><p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Seventh Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</i>”
</p>
<p>The institution of marriage is of very ancient date. When Eve had been formed out
of the rib of Adam, and was brought to him, he exclaimed, “She is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh,” and the account of the first marriage concludes thus: “Therefore
man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife, and they shall
be one flesh” (Gen. ii. 24). Every married couple, husband and wife, bind themselves
by a solemn promise to be true and faithful to each other, to remain throughout life
united in love <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>and affection, and to establish a home founded on purity and sanctity. Adultery is
the breaking of this promise. That love and affection which unites man and wife cannot
be shared by a third person without involving a breach of the seventh commandment.
</p>
<p>Jewish homes have always been distinguished by sanctity and purity. In order to retain
this distinction it is necessary that we should be trained in this virtue from our
childhood. Our language must be pure and holy; unclean and indecent expressions must
never be uttered in our homes, either by the old or by the young. The purer our speech
is, the more sanctified will our heart be. Bad society often corrupts the heart of
the young through bad example in words and conduct. It is therefore essential that
immoral persons should not come in contact with our children; that everything that
is contrary to the virtue of modesty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צניעות‎</span>) should be rigorously excluded from Jewish homes.
</p>
<p>The seventh commandment forbids:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> Faithlessness of a man to his wife, or a woman to her husband. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> The use of improper and indecent language. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> Immodest conduct. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> Associating with immoral persons. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Eighth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not steal.</i>”
</p>
<p>We do not like that any one should take a part of our property without our knowledge
or consent. An old saying of the Rabbis teaches: “Let the property <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>of thy neighbour be as dear in thy eyes as thine own” (Aboth ii. 12); that is to say,
as you do not wish a diminution or destruction of what is yours, so you must not cause
a diminution or destruction of what belongs to your neighbour.
</p>
<p>By secretly taking anything for ourselves that does not belong to us, we steal, and
break the eighth commandment.
</p>
<p>This commandment has also a wider sense, and forbids every illegal acquisition of
property, whether it be directly by theft or robbery, or by cheating, by embezzlement
or forgery. Property acquired by any of these or similar means may be considered as
stolen property, and is by no means a blessing to him who possesses it. Even if human
justice does not reach the evil-doer, he is watched by an All-seeing Eye, and will
in due time receive his full punishment.
</p>
<p>This commandment prohibits:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> Theft and robbery. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> All kinds of fraud and dishonesty. </li>

<h4 class="main"><i>Ninth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</i>”
</p>
<p>It gives us pain to hear that others speak ill of us. “Let the honour of thy neighbour
be as dear to thee as thine own” (Aboth ii. 10). We must therefore not speak ill of
our neighbour. But it is not only the speaking ill of others that this commandment
forbids; we must not say of our fellow-man anything that is not true. If we are called
as a witness in a <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>court of justice, we must be most careful that every word we utter be perfectly true.
We must weigh our words well and guard ourselves against stating as facts things about
which we are not quite certain. If we are careless we may become false witnesses,
and may even be guilty of perjury.
</p>
<p>The consequences of false evidence are of a very grave nature; it misleads the judge,
perverts justice, ruins innocent people; and the false witness himself—whether he
sinned with intention or by carelessness—will not escape punishment.
</p>
<p>God declared through the mouth of the prophet Zechariah (v. 4): “I will bring forth
the curse, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief
and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall remain in
the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones
thereof.”
</p>
<p>In order to guard ourselves against the possibility of such a crime, we must train
ourselves in speaking the exact truth in everything, however trifling it may appear
to us. Even in their play children must be careful in what they utter. Idle talk,
gossip, frequently leads us to speak of our neighbours what is not in harmony with
facts. Though we may believe it to be harmless and to have no evil consequence, it
has in reality very pernicious results; for we get into the habit of being careless
about our words, and of ignoring the line that parts truth from falsehood, and when
we have then to speak on more important things, or even in a court of justice, we
may prove ourselves equally careless. There is a proverb (Prov. xix. 5): <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>“A faithful witness is he who doth not lie, but he who uttereth lies will be a false
witness;” i.e., the conduct of a witness with regard to truth in ordinary and less
important utterances is a test of his trustworthiness in more important matters.
</p>
<p>The ninth commandment—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> Forbids us to give false evidence; and </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> To utter an untruth of any kind whatever. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> It commands us to be careful in our utterances. </li>

<h4 class="main"><i>Tenth Commandment.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“<i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife,
nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing
that is thy neighbour’s.</i><span class="corr" id="xd32e7259" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>The coveting which the tenth commandment forbids is the root from which the crimes
forbidden in the four preceding commandments spring. Coveting is a desire to possess
what we cannot get in an honest and legal manner. An instance of such coveting is
the desire of Ahab to possess the vineyard of Naboth. It must have been more than
an ordinary desire, for it led him to most wicked acts (1 Kings xxi.).
</p>
<p>It is not every desire that is prohibited. If we see a thing that pleases us, we begin
to feel a desire for its possession. Our reason must then step in and tell us whether
we can obtain it in an honest way or not. In the latter case we must conquer our desire
and suppress it, lest it obtain the mastery over us.
</p>
<p>We must work and try to make progress. We cannot be blamed if we are not quite content
with our <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>present condition, and wish to improve it. Without such a desire all industry and
progress would disappear. But we must consider that the improvement of our material
condition, the increase of our property, is not the whole mission of man. We must
not forget that we have a higher mission: to improve our heart and our moral conduct,
and to make ourselves worthy of being called “the children of God.” The increase of
our property must not impede the progress of the purity and goodness of our heart.
</p>
<p>The tenth commandment—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> Forbids us to covet that which does not belong to us; and </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> Commands us to suppress any such desire when it rises in our heart. </li>

<div class="div3 last-child section" id="ch2.1.0">
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.1.1" class="first small"><span class="sc">Note 1.</span>—There is another way of enumerating the Ten Commandments, namely, to combine the
first and the second into one, and to divide the tenth into two. The Masoretic text
seems to point in this direction; for there is no pause between the first and the
second commandments, while there is one in the middle of the tenth. The inference
from the Masoretic text, however, is not quite certain. It is possible that the first
two commandments were joined closely together in order to separate more pointedly
those commandments in which God speaks of Himself in the first person from those in
which He speaks of Himself in the third person; or, to use the words of the Midrash,
to separate the first two, which the Israelites heard directly from God, from the
rest, which they heard through Moses. The last commandment was, on account of its
great importance, given in two different forms. In the first the general term “house”
is employed; in the second the various elements constituting the “house” are enumerated
instead. The two forms of the commandment are separated by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>sign of a pause, because each of them is complete in itself<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Tradition supports our division of the Decalogue. “I am” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אנכי‎</span>) and “Thou shalt not have” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא יהיה לך‎</span>) are mentioned in Talmud and Midrash, also in Targum, as two distinct commandments.
According to Philo (On the Ten Comm.) and Josephus (Antiq. III. v. 5), the verse,
“Thou shalt have … before me” belongs to the first commandment.
</p>
<p class="small">The text of the Decalogue, as repeated by Moses in the plain of Moab (Deut. v. 6–8),
differs from the original (Exod. xx. 2–14). One of the differences, the first word
of the fourth commandment—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכור‎</span>, “Remember,” in Exodus, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמור‎</span>, “Observe,” in Deuteronomy—is pointed out in Midrash and Talmud, and also in the
hymn for the Eve of Sabbath, beginning, “Come, my friend” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לכה דודי‎</span>). Tradition explains the first expression as referring to affirmative commandments,
and the second to prohibitions; it further teaches that “both expressions were spoken
by God simultaneously;” that is to say, the fourth commandment in Deuteronomy, though
different in form, does not imply anything that has not been revealed by God on Mount
Sinai. The same applies to all points of difference.
</p>
<p class="small">Why did Moses introduce the alterations? Ibn Ezra, in his Commentary on the Decalogue,
is of opinion that the question need not be asked, or answered if asked, because in
the repetition of a Divine message the original words may be changed so long as the
sense remains intact. But the addition of the phrase, “as the Lord thy God commandeth
thee” in two cases, and the reference to the deliverance from Egyptian servitude,
substituted (in Deut.) in the fourth commandment for the reference to the Creation
(in Exod.), lead us to think that the changes were not introduced unintentionally
or without any purpose. The repeated Decalogue is a portion of an address in which
Moses exhorted a new generation in the plains of Moab to obey the Divine Law. It is,
therefore, not unlikely that he made additions <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>and alterations for the sake of emphasis, where he noticed a certain laxity among
those whom he addressed. Having come in contact with heathen nations and observed
their rites in connection with their sacred days, the Israelites may have been inclined
to imitate them; they were therefore exhorted to sanctify the Sabbath in the way God
commanded; hence also the more emphatic “Observe,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמור‎</span>.—A similar reason may have caused the addition of the same phrase, “as the Lord,
&amp;c.,” to the fifth commandment. The participation of a portion of the Israelites in
the licentious feasts of the Moabites and Midianites disturbed the peace of their
homes and loosened the sacred family tie. Moses therefore points to the Divine origin
of the law commanding obedience to parents, and also emphasises the blessings which
it will yield by adding the words, “and in order that it may be well with thee.”—The
change of circumstances has also caused another alteration in the fourth commandment.
During the forty years which the Israelites were compelled to spend in the wilderness,
they almost forgot the condition of their former servitude; the new generation did
not know it at all, and they grudged their slaves the one day of rest in the week.
They were therefore reminded of their servitude in Egypt, and were asked to remember
it in order that they might, out of gratitude to the Almighty, keep the Sabbath as
He commanded them.
</p>
<p class="small">Another indication that changed circumstances caused the alterations is noticed in
the tenth commandment. Having arrived at the border of Palestine, the Israelites were
about to take possession of houses and fields, and two and a half tribes were already
in possession of landed property. The term “house” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span>), which at first denoted “the home” or “the household,” including the wife, was now
in the minds of the people chiefly “a permanent building.” “The wife,” the centre
and the chief element in the home, was therefore substituted for “the house” in the
first part of <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>the commandment, and vice versâ, “the house” for “the wife” in the second part, where
appropriately “nor his field” has been added.—The substitution of “Thou shalt not
desire” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא תתאוה‎</span>) for the original “Thou shalt not covet” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא תחמוד‎</span>) may have been intended to teach the Israelites that all kinds and degrees of desire
were forbidden, and to remind them of the consequences of desire which they had experienced
at “the graves of the desire” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קברות התאוה‎</span> Num. xi.).—One more important alteration is to be noticed, the conjunctive “and”
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְ‎</span>) before the seventh and the following commandments, which served to create in the
minds of the hearers the idea that the crimes forbidden in the second part of the
Decalogue are to some extent connected, and that he who broke one of these commandments
was likely to break the others also. We are thus bidden to be on our guard, and to
take good care that none of them be violated by us.
</p>
<p id="ch2.1.2" class="small"><span class="sc">Note 2.</span>—Ibn Ezra, in his Commentary on Exodus xx. 9, says: “Rabbi Jehudah ha-levi asked me
why it is said in the Decalogue, ‘who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondage,’ and not ‘who created heaven and earth.’ My answer was as follows:
Know that those who believe in God have not all the same kind of faith. Some believe
because they were told of His existence by others; those who believe in God because
the holy Torah teaches this belief possess a higher degree of faith. If an unbeliever
argues with either of these, they are not able to refute his argument. Those, however,
who study sciences—Astronomy, Botany, Zoology, and Anthropology—learn to understand
the works and the ways of God, and from these the Creator Himself. The words ‘I am
the Lord thy God’ can only be understood by the wise and intelligent of all nations.
For they all see that God has made heaven and earth. But there is this difference:
the Israelites believe that the Creation has taken place five thousand years ago:
non-Israelites assume that God has been continually creating <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>from eternity. Now, God wrought signs and wonders in Egypt by which He delivered the
Israelites out of Egypt, and thus showed them His Divine justice and goodness. In
reference <i>to these miracles</i> it is said, ‘<i>Thou hast been shown to know that the Lord is God</i>;’ all Israelites, wise and simple, equally witnessed His miracles. The beginning
of the Decalogue, therefore, ‘I am the Lord thy God,’ is well understood by the wise;
but for the rest of the nation the words ‘who brought thee out,’ &amp;c., have been added,
in order that all without exception should understand it.”
</p>
<p id="ch2.1.3" class="small"><span class="sc">Note 3.</span>—Don Isaac Abarbanel, in his Commentary on Exodus xx., says: “The Ten Commandments
are distinguished from the other Divine precepts in three things: they were directly
communicated by God to the Israelites, not through a prophet; they were revealed to
a whole nation at once; and they were written on the two tables of stone by the finger
of God. Such distinction necessarily indicates a greater intrinsic value of the Ten
Commandments. My opinion is therefore that they are laws of a general character, and
principles including all the 613 precepts which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave
to His people. <i>E.g.</i>, love and worship of God. sanctification of His Name, submission to His judgment,
fear of God, reverence of His sanctuary, and other duties towards God; Passover, Tabernacles,
Tefillin, Mezuzah, and such other precepts as are ‘a memorial of the departure from
Egypt;’ the separation of the first-born, tithes, &amp;c.—all these duties are implied
in the first commandment. Also Rabbi Levi ben Gershon and the Gaon Saadiah assume
that all the 613 precepts are implicitly contained in the Decalogue. Although all
precepts involving practice (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוות מעשיות‎</span>) are implied in the Decalogue, and even allusions to each one of the thirteen principles
of faith may be discovered in it, there is no precept concerning our faith. It has
already been proved by Rabbi Chisdai that by the Divine commands we are either <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>told <i>to do</i> a certain thing, or told <i>not to do</i> a certain thing; but what we have <i>to believe</i> or <i>not to believe</i> the Almighty <i>taught</i> us through signs, wonders, and revelation. The words ‘I am the Lord thy God, who
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,’ teach a certain
truth, a principle from which many of the 613 precepts may be derived, but which is
in itself no commandment.—The Decalogue (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשרת הדברים‎</span>) must therefore not be understood as designating ten commandments, but ‘ten words’
or ‘ten paragraphs’ indicated in the Hebrew text by the pauses, or spaces left between
two paragraphs.
</p>
<p class="small">“The ‘ten words’ were written on two tables, five on each. The first five, containing
positive and negative precepts, with the announcement of reward and punishment, were
exclusively addressed to the Israelites. The latter five are simple prohibitions without
any mention of punishment; because they were addressed to man as man, and include
only such laws as are also suggested to him by human reason, without direct revelation.”
</p>
<p class="small">Rabbi R.&nbsp;S. Hirsch, in his Commentary on Exodus xx., says in reference to the first
commandment: “As this verse is not understood as a mere declaration, but as a commandment
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוה‎</span>)<span class="corr" id="xd32e7374" title="Source: .">,</span> it does not say ‘I am thy God,’ but ‘I, the Lord, <i>shall be</i> thy God,’ and thus contains as the foundation of all our duties towards God an exhortation
to acknowledge the sovereignty of God, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת עול מלכות שמים‎</span>.
</p>
<p class="small">“The so-called ‘belief in the existence of God,’ as ancient and modern theologians
generally express this idea, differs widely from that which underlies this fundamental
doctrine of Judaism. The truth which affords me the foundation of a Jewish life is
not the belief that there is a God, or that there is only one God, but the conviction
that this One, Only, and true God is <i>my</i> God; that He has created and formed me, has placed me here, and given me certain
duties; that He constantly makes and forms me, preserves, protects, <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>directs, and guides me; not the belief that I, an accidental product of the Universe
whose First Cause He was millions of years ago, am through a chain of thousands of
intervening beings related to Him, but the belief that every moment of my existence
is a direct personal gift from the Almighty and All-good, and that every moment of
my life ought to be spent in His service; not the knowledge that there is a God, but
the recognition of God as my God, as the sole Cause of my fate, and my sole Guide
in all that I do, gives me the foundation for my religious life. The response to the
exhortation, ‘I shall be thy God,’ is ‘Thou art my God.’ ”
</p>
<p id="ch2.1.4" class="small"><span class="sc">Note 4.</span>—The importance attached to the Decalogue may be gathered from the various attempts
made, on the one hand, to classify the Divine laws according to the Ten Commandments,
showing that the latter contain all the 613 precepts; and, on the other hand, to find
in such important passages as the <i>Shema</i> and Leviticus xix. a parallel for each of the Ten Commandments. (Jerus. Talm. Ber.,
chap. i.; Rabboth, Vayyikra <i>ad locum</i>.)

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ten Commandments, flowing as it were from the one source, “I am the Lord thy God,”
branch off in all directions, and penetrate all man’s relations, guide him in his
conduct towards God, towards his fellow-men and towards himself, and teach him how
to rule his thought, his speech, and his actions. When the Almighty proclaims to us,
“I am the Lord thy God,” we willingly respond, “Thou art my God.” But this declaration
involves also duties on our part, the fulfilment of which is the natural consequence
and the verification of our response. If our words, “Thou <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>art my God,” come from our hearts, and are not empty sounds, uttered merely by the
lips, we must be conscious of the duties they impose on us. These are:—

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.1" class="first">1. <i>Fear of God.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יראת השם‎</span>—The true knowledge of God, of His Wisdom and Greatness, as visible in His works,
leads us to fear God; that is, to fear doing anything that might displease Him and
make us unworthy of His love. It is not a fear that terrifies us and drives us away
from His presence; on the contrary, it draws us nearer to Him, and causes us to try
to become more and more worthy of His love.
</p>
<p>“And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to fear the Lord
thy God?” (Deut. x. 12).
</p>
<p>“<span class="corr" id="xd32e7445" title="Source: It">If</span> thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book,
that thou mayest fear this name which is to be honoured and revered, the Lord thy
God; then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful” (Deut. xxviii. 58).
</p>
<p>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. i. 7).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord” (Ps. cxi. 10).
</p>
<p>“The fear of the Lord is to hate evil” (Prov. viii. 13).
</p>
<p>“The fear of the Lord prolongeth days” (Prov. x. 27).
</p>
<p>“Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man” (Eccles.
xii. 13).
</p>
<p>“He who possesses learning but is without fear of God, resembles a treasurer who has
the key for the inner door, but not for the outer one” (Babyl. Talm. Sabb. 31<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p>“Everything is in the hand of God except the fear of God” (Babyl. Talm. Ber. 33<i>b</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7463src" href="#xd32e7463">3</a>
</p>
<p>2. <i>Love of God.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבת השם‎</span>—The true fear of God is associated with the love of God. The latter means the constant
longing for communion with Him, feeling happy and joyful when with Him, but unhappy
and miserable when without Him. Love of God creates in us an anxiety to do everything
in our power that might please the Almighty. He who is filled with love of God is
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסיד‎</span>, pious; he does not rest content with doing what he is commanded, but <i>anxiously seeks the opportunity</i> of fulfilling a Divine command; he is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רודף אחר המצות‎</span>, “eager in the pursuit of Mitsvoth.” The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge,
but love of God is the aim and end of all our religious thinking and striving.
</p>
<p>“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might” (Deut. vi. 5).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The Lord preserveth all those who love him (Ps. cxlv. 20).
</p>
<p>“Thou wilt show me the path of life. In thy presence is fulness of joy; in thy right
hand there are pleasures for evermore” (Ps. xvi. 11).
</p>
<p>“As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God”
(Ps. xlii. 2).
</p>
<p>“Blessed are they who dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee” (Ps. lxxxiv.
5).
</p>
<p>“The desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee” (Isa. xxvi.
8).
</p>
<p>“I will rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in the God of my salvation” (Hab. iii. 18).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.3">3. <i>Gratitude towards God.</i>—All that we possess, the very breath we breathe, is a present received at the hands
of the Almighty. Whatever success we desire to achieve, whatever undertaking we desire
to accomplish, we must ourselves first strive for it to the utmost of our power, and
this done, we may hope for the Divine blessing. When we have attained what we sought,
we are warned against believing that “our power and the strength of our hand hath
gotten us this wealth.” We are to “remember the Lord our God, for it is he that giveth
us power to get wealth” (Deut. viii. 17–18).
</p>
<p>“For all things come of thee, and of thine own hand have we given thee” (1 Chron.
xxix. 14).
</p>
<p>“Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me” (Ps. l. 23).
</p>
<p>“Though all sacrifices should cease, the sacrifice of thanksgiving will never cease”
(Vayyikra Rabba ix.).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.4">4. <i>Reverence for His Name.</i>—The more we fear and love God, the deeper and the more intense is our feeling <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>of reverence for everything which is connected in our thoughts with the name of the
Almighty. Whenever we enter a place dedicated to His worship, or open the Book that
bears His name, or celebrate the days set apart as “seasons of the Lord,” this feeling
of reverence overcomes us, and finds expression in our conduct. The reverence for
the name of God impels us also to respect ministers and teachers who spend their life
in spreading the knowledge of God and His Will.
</p>
<p>“How awful is this place! this is none other but the house of God” (Gen. xxviii. 17).
</p>
<p>“I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I
worship toward thy holy temple” (Ps. v. 8).
</p>
<p>“When I will publish the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness unto our God” (Deut.
xxxii. 3).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.5">5. <i>Obedience to the Will of God.</i>—Whatever the Almighty, whom we love and fear, bids us do, we not only do, but find
pleasure in doing.
</p>
<p>“To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion
is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry” (1 Sam.
xv. 22, 23).
</p>
<p>“But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and
ye shall be my people” (Jer. vii. 23).
</p>
<p>“Thy statutes have been my song in the house of my pilgrimage” (Ps. cxix. 54).
</p>
<p>“Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing
of my heart” (Ps. cxix. 111).
</p>
<p>“Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>ears hast thou opened; burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then
said I, Lo, I come with the volume of the book written for me: I delight to do thy
will, O my God: yea, thy law is written within my heart” (Ps. xl. 7–9).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.6">6. <i>Faith and Confidence in God.</i>—God is All-kind, All-wise, and All-powerful. The Lord is good to all, and His mercy
is over all His creatures: He wills that which is good for us. Being All-wise, He
knows best what is good for us, and by what means it can be attained; being All-powerful,
He can always carry His Will into effect. He is, therefore, the only Being to whom
we can safely entrust ourselves everywhere and always. In His words and commands,
exhortations and warnings, we have the best and surest guide through life. Our confidence
in God causes us to turn to Him for help in time of need, and for comfort in time
of sorrow.
</p>
<p>“Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake; and with my spirit
my body also: the Lord is for me, and I shall not fear” (Daily Prayers, Morning Service).
</p>
<p>“Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is” (Jer. xvii.
7).
</p>
<p>“Trust in the Lord, and do good” (Ps. xxxvii. 3).
</p>
<p>“Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart; and wait
on the Lord” (Ps. xxvii. 14).
</p>
<p>“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” (Ps. xxiii. 1).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.1.7">7. <i>Resignation to the Will of God.</i>—Trusting in God’s goodness, we are contented with the lot which <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>He determined for us. When we are prosperous we hope for His protection, lest we become
corrupted and unworthy of His goodness; when we fail, faith in God will keep us from
despair and encourage us to fresh attempts; when misfortune befalls us which it is
impossible for us to remedy, we resign ourselves unto His Will, and say, “The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away! blessed be the Name of the Lord!”
</p>
<p>“My flesh and my heart failed; but God is the strength of my heart and my portion
for ever” (Ps. lxxiii. 26).
</p>
<p>“I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercy
is great” (2 Sam. xxiv. 14).
</p>
<p>“We are bound to bless God in evil even as we bless Him in good fortune. It is written:
‘And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy might’ (Deut. vi. 5); love Him <i>with all thy soul or life</i>—<i>i.e.</i>, even though for His sake thou risk thy life; <i>and with all thy wealth</i>—that is, whatever measure He metes out to thee, acknowledge with exceeding gratitude”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7547src" href="#xd32e7547">4</a> (Mishnah Berachoth ix. 5).

<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>b.</i>)</span> <i>Duties towards God: In Speech.</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The feelings of fear and love of God, of reverence, obedience, faith, gratitude, and
resignation, must also <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>find adequate expression in our speech. God, the Omniscient, knows our thoughts and
sentiments, and there would be no necessity for giving them an outward expression,
if we only intended thereby to make them known to the Almighty. But as in our relations
to our fellow-men—<i>e.g.</i>, to our parents or to our children—we frequently, in obedience to an irresistible
impulse, communicate to them in words what we think and what we feel, even when convinced
that we only tell them things well known to them already, so we address the Almighty,
who is everywhere near unto us, and listens to our speech, although our wishes are
known to Him before we utter them, and our innermost feelings are open before Him
before we express them in words. We are aware that there is an immeasurable difference
between the Divine Being and earthly creatures like ourselves. We know that He is
not subject to human weaknesses, and that the audible sound of words cannot move Him
more than the thoughts and feelings that prompt the words to come forth. And yet the
mere communion of our heart with our Creator does not satisfy us; we feel ourselves
impelled by some inner force to give it an outward expression. Besides, there is a
constant interaction between our thoughts and our spoken words. Thoughts and feelings
that remain unspoken, are seldom permanent: we soon cease to be conscious of them
ourselves, and they often disappear without leaving any trace behind them, whilst
sentiments and ideas expressed in spoken words become strengthened and take a deeper
and firmer root in our hearts. The relationship between our lips and our heart is
therefore <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>of mutual benefit to both: the words uttered with the lips receive their value and
importance from the heart, and the emotions of the heart derive strength and support
from the lips.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.2.1">1. <i>Prayer.</i>—All our feelings and sentiments towards the Almighty, our love and fear, faith and
confidence, gratitude and resignation, find in Divine worship their due expression.
When our soul is full of the love of God, and yearns for His presence, we call upon
Him in hymns and songs of praise, and He is “nigh to all them who call upon him, to
all that call upon him in truth” (Ps. cxlv. 18).
</p>
<p>“I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I
have any being. Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in the Lord” (Ps.
civ. 33, 34).
</p>
<p>“Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant,
and praise is comely” (Ps. cxlvii. 1).
</p>
<p>“I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth”
(Ps. xxxiv. 2).
</p>
<p>“O Lord, open my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise” (Ps. li. 17)
</p>
<p>Our desire to please Him whom we love sincerely, our longing for an opportunity to
do what is good in His eyes, ought not to remain hidden and silent. The sooner and
the more frequently we give expression to these wishes in audible words, the sooner
do they become realised, and the sooner are the promptings of our heart followed by
deeds.
</p>
<p>“With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth” (Ps. cxix. 13).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How sweet are thy words unto my palate! yea, sweeter to my mouth than honey” (Ps.
cxix. 103).
</p>
<p>“Let my tongue sing of thy word; for all thy commandments are righteousness” (Ps.
cxix. 172).
</p>
<p>We fear lest we offend and displease Him by our words or acts; we recall to our mind
the holiness of a God “who has no pleasure in wickedness, and with whom evil shall
not sojourn” (Ps. v. 5); we not only meditate on the Holy One, but speak and sing
of Him. Our meditation finds expression in songs on the holiness of God, and these
songs again supply fresh material for meditation; we thus hope to fence and guard
our heart against the intrusion of anything unworthy of the presence of the Most Holy.
</p>
<p>“Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? He
that hath clean hands and a pure heart” (Ps. xxiv. 3, 4).
</p>
<p>“I will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar” (Ps. xxvi. 6).
</p>
<p>Our weakness and helplessness in many conditions of life fill us with trouble and
care. When we enjoy good health, we fear a change might take place; in possession
of wealth, we are in anxiety: it might be taken from us. The pleasures of home and
family we know to be but temporary: how soon may sorrow visit us there! From all these
fears and anxieties we seek and find refuge in Him, who is “a stronghold to the weak,
a stronghold in times of trouble” (Ps. ix. 10). We tell Him confidently all the troubles
and cares of our heart, as we would do to a friend who is always willing and ready
to help us. We have faith in God, and therefore we approach Him <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>with our petitions; and when we have poured forth our heart before the All-merciful
we feel more at ease, and our faith and confidence have gained in strength.
</p>
<p>“He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will
deliver him and honour him” (Ps. xci. 15).
</p>
<p>“When they have cried unto the Lord in their trouble, he will save them out of their
distresses” (Ps. cvii. 6).
</p>
<p>“Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long
as I live. When I find trouble and sorrow, then will I call upon the name of the Lord.
When I take the cup of salvation, then will I call upon the name of the Lord” (Ps.
cxvi. 2, 4, 13).
</p>
<p>“What sufferings may be called chastisements of love? Such as do not prevent us from
prayer” (Babyl. Talm. Ber. 5<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>“Even when the edge of the sword touches already a man’s neck, even then he must not
abandon his faith in praying to God” (Babyl. Talm. Ber. 10<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>“ ‘I was asleep, but my heart was awake;’ I have no sacrifices, but I have ‘Shema’
and ‘Prayer’ ” (Shir ha-shirim Rabba on v. 2).
</p>
<p>“ ‘Hope in the Lord,’ and pray again” (Rabboth, Deuter., chap. ii.).
</p>
<p>Our Rabbis teach, “Prayer is good for man both before his fate has been decreed and
after it has been decreed” (Babyl. Talm. Rosh-hashshanah, p. 16<i>a</i>). But at the same time we are warned against impatiently expecting and demanding
an immediate effect from the words uttered by our lips, however devoutly they may
have been spoken. Such expectation—denounced in <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>the Talmud as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיון תפלה‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7625src" href="#xd32e7625">5</a>—would indicate our confidence in the wisdom of our petition, whilst confidence in
the wisdom and goodness of God would suggest that “the Lord will do what is good in
his eyes.”
</p>
<p>We give expression to our feelings of <i>gratitude</i> towards our benefactor by acknowledging the fact, that whatever we enjoy, we are
enabled to enjoy through His kindness. The various blessings formulated by our Sages
serve a double purpose: first, they facilitate the expression of our feelings; secondly,
they remind us of the presence of the Almighty, and of His goodness in providing for
us and all His creatures. From the time we awake in the morning till the evening when
we lie down to sleep, there is not a moment that does not bring to our knowledge some
Divine act of kindness towards us. In the morning we perceive the benefit of light,
in the evening we have reason to welcome the blessing of repose it brings with it,
while the interval between the two periods constantly reveals to him who does not
wilfully shut his eyes the hand of Him “who is good, and whose loving-kindness endureth
for ever.”
</p>
<p>“I will give thanks to thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation”
(Ps. cxviii. 21).
</p>
<p>“I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanks giving” (Jon. ii. 10).
</p>
<p>“Though all prayers were to be discontinued, <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>prayers of thanksgiving will never be discontinued” (Vayyikra Rabba, chap. ix.).
</p>
<p>When things happen which are not pleasant to us, which give us pain and sorrow, we
ought to consider that the plans of God are different from our plans, and His ways
from our ways, and what He wills is better for us than our own wishes. With resignation,
without murmuring, we ought to utter words of praise and thanks to the Almighty.
</p>
<p>“The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (Job
i. 21).
</p>
<p>“Learn to say, ‘Whatever the Almighty does, is done for our good’ ” (Babyl. Talm.
Ber. 60<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p><i>Public Service.</i>—Man has a natural desire to communicate his sentiments to his fellow-men, and finds
a certain pleasure or relief in knowing that others share in his joys and sorrows.
The same is the case with regard to his sentiments towards the Most High. If, yearning
for communion with God, we fervently appeal to Him in solitude, where we are undisturbed
by the intrusion of any other person, it will not be long before we shall feel ourselves
in the very presence of Him who is “nigh to all those who call upon him in truth.”
Standing before the Almighty, the Creator and Master of the whole Universe as well
as of ourselves, we should like all nature to join in His praises, and we summon the
inhabitants of the heavens above, His angels and hosts, sun, moon, and all the stars
of light; and the dwellers on earth below, inanimate and animate, irrational and rational,
kings with their peoples, to come and to praise the name of God (Ps. cxlviii.). Such
moments of solitary devotion are very precious, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>are by no means to be despised. But they are not frequent, and not always successful.
Public worship has this advantage, that the object of our meeting, the holiness of
the place, and the union in a worship with our fellow-men combine to create, maintain,
or intensify our devotion. Although each one has his individual wants, joys, and sorrows,
there are many wants, joys, and sorrows which we have all in common, and concerning
which we may in common give expression to our feelings in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving.
</p>
<p>“Bless ye the Lord in congregations” (Ps. lxviii. 27).
</p>
<p>“If ten pray together, the presence of God is with them” (Babyl. Talm. Ber. 6<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>“ ‘But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time’ (Ps. lxix.
14): which is the acceptable time? The time of public worship” (Babyl. Talm. Ber.
8<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.2.2">2. <i>Study of the Law</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תלמוד תורה‎</span>).—Another way of employing speech in the service of the Lord is the reading and the
study of the Word of God: the Holy Scriptures and their Commentaries. Our love and
reverence of God ought to induce us frequently to consult the book which contains
His commandments, and which He has given us as a guide and companion. Even if we derived
no further benefit than the consciousness of having spent some time in reading His
Word revealed to us by the mouth of the Prophets, the time thus spent would not be
wasted. But we derive a further advantage. It is impossible to imagine that our devoting
a certain time, however short it may be, to the reading of the words of the Most Holy
should have no purifying influence upon us, provided <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>we approach the book before us with due reverence, and with the intention to be guided
by its teachings.
</p>
<p>Joshua, when placed at the head of the nation, is exhorted by the Almighty as follows:
“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein
day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein”
(Joshua i. 8).
</p>
<p>“As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: my spirit that is upon
thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth,
nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the
Lord, from henceforth and for ever.”<span class="corr" id="xd32e7677" title="Added by author"> (Is. lix., 21)</span>
</p>
<p>3. <i>Teaching.</i>—The gift of speech is of service also in communicating our thoughts, feelings, and
convictions to our fellow-men. They who are able to read the Word of God and to understand
it, ought to read and expound it to those who are less favoured; they who feel the
presence of God, and comprehend His holiness, goodness, and unity, ought to direct
the hearts of their brethren to God, His words and works. It is a special duty and
privilege of the Jew to proclaim and teach the Existence and the Unity of God—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יחוד הבורא‎</span><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>“And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when
thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
down and when thou risest up” (Deut. vi. 7).
</p>
<p>“Happy are we! how goodly is our portion, and how pleasant is our lot, and how beautiful
our heritage! Happy are we who early and late, morning and <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>evening, twice every day, declare, ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord
is One’!” (Daily Prayers, Morning Service).
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reverence of the Name of God.</i>—The mention of the name of God ought to make us most careful about that which we
utter in connection with it. If a person makes a promise or statement on oath carelessly
or with levity, he shows that he has no reverence of the name of God; no fear of God.
It is only through such irreverence that a person is capable of breaking the third
commandment. Blasphemy, a sin treated in the Bible as a capital crime, has likewise
its source in want of due reverence of God’s name. In order to preserve and strengthen
that reverence we must avoid pronouncing the Divine name too frequently. Hence arose
the custom of substituting such words as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏השם‎</span> “the Name,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המקום‎</span> “the Omnipresent,” for the names of God, and employing in ordinary writing letters
like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ד‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יי‎</span> instead of any of the Divine names. In writing single letters instead of the full
names we also intend to guard ourselves against causing irreverence towards the name
of God; as our writing is frequently destroyed or liable to be thrown among the refuse.
This precaution, dictated by a feeling of reverence for God and His name, serves at
the same time to strengthen that feeling.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7713src" href="#xd32e7713">6</a>
</p>
<p>From the same reason, the word which is exclusively <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>used as a name of God, the Tetragrammaton,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7720src" href="#xd32e7720">7</a> was rarely pronounced, and in reading the Bible the word <i>Adonai</i>, “My Lord,” is substituted wherever it occurs. It was only pronounced in the Temple
by the High-priest on the Day of Atonement, in the Confession of Sins, and in the
Prayer for Forgiveness; and by the ordinary priests when they blessed the people in
accordance with the Divine precepts (Num. vi. 24–26). Since the destruction of the
Temple the Tetragrammaton has not been pronounced, and thus it has come about that
the right pronunciation of the word is at present unknown.
</p>
<p>5. The consciousness that we frequently address the Almighty with our lips, and read
His Holy Word, ought to make us strive for the utmost purity and holiness in our speech.
When the prophet Isaiah, in a Divine vision, perceived the majesty of the Most High,
and heard the sound of His ministering angels proclaiming His holiness, a sense of
his own failings forced even from this chosen messenger of God the confession, “Woe
is me! for I am undone; because I am a man, unclean in lips, and I dwell in the midst
of a people unclean in lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts”
(Isa. vi. 5).

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Duties towards God: In our Actions.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rabbi Jose teaches, “Let <i>all thy deeds</i> be in the service of heaven,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל מעשיך יהיו לשם שמים‎</span> (Sayings of the Fathers, ii. 12).
</p>
<p>The feeling of love and fear of God which fills our <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>heart and soul, and to which we frequently give expression in words, must also be
visible in our actions. Our whole life must be devoted to His service, and ought to
be one continuous worship of God. Every act of ours must aim at the sanctification
of His name. He has revealed unto us His Will, and shown us the way in which we should
walk; unconditional submission to His guidance and strict obedience to His command
should distinguish the people of the Lord. True love of God and faith in His goodness
make us “bold as a leopard, light as an eagle, swift as a stag, and strong as a lion
to carry out the will of our Father in heaven” (Sayings of the Fathers, v. 20). For
what could be the value of our professions of love for God, if we refused to listen
attentively to His voice, to walk in the way He has prepared for us, or to observe
His statutes? From this point of view we may consider all our duties as duties towards
God, since their fulfilment implies obedience to His Will. But there are certain duties
which chiefly or exclusively concern our relations to God. Such duties are: the observance
of Sabbath and Festivals, providing reminders of God’s Presence, establishing and
supporting Public Worship, sanctifying God’s Name (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדוש השם‎</span>), and imitating His ways. Of these duties, the first three will be fully treated
in special sections.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.3.1"><i>The sanctification of God’s Name</i> is a duty incumbent on all mankind, but it is incumbent on us Jews in a higher degree,
for we are called the people of the Lord, the chosen people, a holy nation, and a
kingdom of priests. We sanctify the name of God by remaining faithful to Him and to
His Word, resisting every kind <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>of force or temptation to turn us away from our faith, making sacrifices for our holy
religion, and conducting ourselves in such a manner that our fellow-men may become
convinced that the tree of our Law bears good and holy fruit. Every action that brings
disgrace upon us as Israelites, and causes our neighbours to despise “the people of
the Lord, who profess to be the guardians of the revealed Torah,” is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלול השם‎</span> “Profanation of the Name of God.” “And ye shall not profane my holy name, but I will
be hallowed among the children of Israel” (Lev. xxii. 32).
</p>
<p>“Profanation of the name of God is a greater sin even than idolatry” (Babyl. Talm.
Sanhedrin 106<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.3.2"><i>Imitating the Ways of God.</i>—We know that God is perfect, and that all His ways are perfect; we are conscious
also of our weakness and of the impossibility of ever becoming perfect. But this conviction
must not deter us from seeking perfection as far as our nature permits it, or from
setting before us the ways of God as an example for us to follow, as the aim which
should direct the course of our life, the balance in which to weigh our actions, and
the test by which to determine their value.
</p>
<p>“Ye shall be holy; for I, the Lord your God, am holy” (Lev. xix. 2).
</p>
<p>“I set the Lord always before me” (Ps. xvi. 8).
</p>
<p>“ ‘Ye shall walk after the Lord your God’ (Deut. xiii. 5). Is it possible for man
to walk after the Lord? Has it not been said, ‘The Lord thy God is a consuming fire’?
(<i>ibid.</i> iv. 24). The meaning of the verse, however, is this: Follow the ways of God: He clothes
the naked, as we are told, ‘And the Lord God <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>made coats of skin for Adam and his wife’ (Gen. iii. 21); do the same. He visits the
sick, as is indicated in the words, ‘And God appeared to him in the plain of Mamre’
(<i>ibid.</i> xviii. 1); you must also visit the sick. He comforts the mourners, as appears from
the passage, ‘And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his
son Isaak’ (<i>ibid.</i> xxv. 11); do the same, and comfort mourners,” &amp;c. (Babyl. Talm. Sotah 14<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>It may happen that we are sometimes disposed to exclude a fellow-man from our brotherly
love. It would be against human nature to love those who have hurt or wronged us.
But, on the other hand, we are taught that we must keep our heart free from feelings
of revenge and hatred. If an offence has been committed against us by our brother,
the Law directs us as follows: “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou
shalt surely reprove thy neighbour, and not bear sin against him. Thou shalt not revenge,
and thou shalt not keep a grudge against the children of thy people, but love thy
fellow-man like thyself: I am the Lord” (Lev. xix. 17, 18). The traditional interpretation
illustrates revenge and grudge in the following way: If your neighbour, after having
been unkind to you, is in need of your assistance, and you refuse it on the ground
of his want of kindness towards you, you are guilty of revenge; if you grant him his
request, but at the same time remind him of his unkind conduct, you are guilty of
“bearing a grudge against your neighbour.” (Sifra, <i>ad locum</i>.)

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?” (Mal. ii. 10). “Thou shalt
love thy fellow-man as thyself” (Lev. xix. 18). These are the sentiments which, according
to the Will of God, ought to guide us in our relation to our fellow-men. When, therefore,
a Gentile came to Hillel and asked him to explain to him in one moment the duties
which Judaism enjoins on its adherents, he replied, “What is displeasing to thee,
that do thou not to others. This is the text of the Law; all the rest is commentary;
go and learn” (Babyl. Talm. Shabbath 31<i>a</i>). In a different form this idea has been expressed by Rabbi Akiba and by Ben-Azai,
who respectively quoted as a fundamental principle of the Law, “Love thy neighbour
as thyself,” and “This is the book of the generations of man; in the day that God
created man, he made him in the likeness of God” (Yalkut on Gen. v. 1).
</p>
<p>From this principle we derive the following general maxims with regard to our neighbour’s
(1) life and health, (2) property, (3) honour, and (4) well-being:—
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.1">1. <i>Life and Health of our Fellow-man.</i>—Life is a precious treasure which the Almighty has given us; if it is once taken
from us, no man is able to restore it. Among the first lessons revealed to man in
Scripture is the value of the life of a human being, created by God in His own likeness,
and when the first murder had been committed, God said to the murderer, “What hast
thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood is heard that crieth unto me from the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>ground” (Gen, iv. 10). The first commandment in the second section of the Decalogue
is directed against this crime: “Thou shalt not murder.” The significance of these
words, the general lessons implied in this commandment, and the extent to which a
person, though not an actual murderer, may become guilty of having broken this commandment,
have already been explained in the chapter on the Ten Commandments (p. 261). It has
been shown how the sixth commandment forbade—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> The taking of the life of a fellow-man by violent means. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> The doing of anything by which the health, the peace, and the well-being of our fellow-man
is undermined. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> The omission of any act in our power to save our fellow-man from direct or indirect
danger of life. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.2">2. <i>The Property of our Neighbour.</i>—The eighth commandment in its wider sense comprehends all our relations to our neighbour’s
property. It prohibits, as has been shown above (p. 263), the appropriation of anything
that belongs to our neighbour—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> By theft and robbery, or </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> By any kind of fraud and dishonesty. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Our Sages teach: “Let the property of thy fellow-man be as dear to thee as thine own”
(Aboth ii. 12); <i>i.e.</i>, you do not like to see your own property damaged, diminished, or destroyed; so it
would be wrong if you were to cause loss and ruin to your fellow-man, whether you
did it directly or indirectly.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7843src" href="#xd32e7843">8</a> Let every <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>one enjoy the labour of his hands; partake of the gifts of the earth and the Divine
blessings as much as his physical and mental powers enable him to do in a righteous
manner.
</p>
<p>It is not only direct illegal appropriation of our neighbour’s goods that is condemned
as theft or robbery; it is equally wicked to buy things which one knows to have been
stolen by others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7851src" href="#xd32e7851">9</a> He who does it is worse than the thief; for, whilst the latter injures only the person
whom he robs, the former encourages and corrupts the thief, hardens his heart, helps
to silence the voice of his conscience, and thus obstructs the way to repentance and
improvement.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.u">There are transactions which are legal and do not involve any breach of the law, and
which are yet condemned by the principles of morality as base and disgraceful. Such
are all transactions in which a person takes advantage of the ignorance or embarrassment
of his neighbour for the purpose of increasing his own property. Usurers frequently
belong to this low and heartless class of society. The worst thing, however, they
do is, that they plan the ruin of others; in many cases they bring about disaster
by inducing young and inexperienced persons to borrow money and to spend it in luxuries,
or increase the embarrassment of the distressed by charging exorbitant interest and
imposing cruel conditions, which make it impossible for those who have once fallen
into the hands of usurers to free themselves from their bondage.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>It makes no difference whatever whether the victim be a Jew or a non-Jew; the transaction
is equally condemnable, and the usurer equally wicked. This statement would be superfluous,
were it not for the misunderstanding that exists both among some of our co-religionists
and among non-Jews with regard to the principle it involves. Great stress is laid
in the Pentateuch on the prohibition of taking interest for advances of money or articles
of food. “And if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee, then thou
shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with
thee. Take thou no interest of him, or increase: but fear thy God, that thy brother
may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
victuals for increase. I am the Lord your God,” &amp;c. (Lev. xxv. 35–38; comp. Exod.
xxii. 24).—It is one of the characteristics of the pious who is worthy to “abide in
the tabernacle of God,” that “he putteth not out his money to usury” (Ps. xv. 5).
</p>
<p>The strict prohibition to take interest on advances of money or goods served a twofold
purpose. In the first place, the surplus money of the wealthy was to be employed in
disinterested charity. Secondly, labour and activity, both physical and mental, were
to be the sources of income and wealth for the individual as well as for the whole
nation; money without labour was not to bear any fruit or produce any increase.
</p>
<p>An exception from this law was made for the benefit of the stranger. The inhabitants
of a town or a country who lived in the midst of their relatives, friends, and countrymen
could, as a rule, be trusted to <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>return the loan in due time. If they were not known themselves, they could find persons
who would recognise them or even offer themselves as security for them. It was different
with the stranger (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הנכרי‎</span>) “who came from a far land” (Deut. xxix. 21); he was not known; he was, as a rule,
without friends; he had none to offer security for him.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7869src" href="#xd32e7869">10</a> When in need, therefore, he would be unlikely to obtain a loan, if the lender were
not permitted in such cases to take interest as compensation for risking the capital
itself. The same reason explains also a second exception made in the law with regard
to a stranger when a debtor. The payment of old debts is, as a rule, a great hardship
to the insolvent, especially at a time when the benefit derived from the loan has
already been forgotten. It was therefore ordained that every seven years a remission
of all debts should take place. The debtor that lived in the country could easily
be urged or forced to pay his debts, and the creditor could safely expect that he
would receive his money before the year of release began. This was not the case with
the stranger, who might with impunity keep out of sight for some time before the beginning
of the seventh year: a circumstance that increased the uncertainty of the repayment,
and would have rendered it almost impossible for a stranger to enjoy the benefit of
a loan in times of temporary embarrassment, but for the exception made in his case
from the law commanding the remission of all debts in the seventh year.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>We see here a difference made in our duties towards our fellow-men between an Israelite
and a stranger, but solely for the benefit of “the stranger.” At present, when the
original relation between the Israelite and the stranger has ceased, the spirit of
charity and justice towards the stranger (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נכרי‎</span>) or non-Jew, which is the basis of this law, must continue to regulate our intercourse
with our neighbours, and if the non-Jew would recognise the prohibition of taking
interest as equally binding upon him as upon the Jew, the latter would not be allowed
to take any kind of interest from a non-Jew. At all events, if any of our co-religionists
take this law as a pretext for imposing upon their non-Jewish fellow-men, and injuring
and ruining them by exorbitant usury, they pervert alike the letter and the spirit
of the Divine command; they do not act in a Jewish spirit, and instead of being members
of a holy nation or the people of the Lord, they are guilty of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלול השם‎</span>, the profanation of the name of God, and do not deserve to be honoured by the name
of Jews.
</p>
<p>Denunciations are sometimes levelled against the Jews, on account of the misdeeds
of some individuals, as cruel usurers. Those non-Jews who would take the trouble of
thoroughly studying Jews and Judaism would soon discover the error and the baselessness
of such denunciations. Judaism has never sanctioned usury, but, on the contrary, always
condemned it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7886src" href="#xd32e7886">11</a>
</p>
<p>With regard to the property of our neighbour our Sages expressed the following maxim:—
</p>
<p>“There are four characters among men: he who <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>says, ‘What is mine is mine and what is thine is thine,’ his is a neutral character;
some say this is a character like that of Sodom; he who says, ‘What is mine is thine
and what is thine is mine’ is a boor; he who says ‘What is mine is thine and what
is thine is thine’ is a saint; he who says ‘What is thine is mine and what is mine
is mine’ is a wicked man” (Aboth v. 10).
</p>
<p>We are not only commanded to abstain from injuring our neighbour with regard to his
property, but we are exhorted to protect it as far as lies in our power. “If thou
meetest the ox of thine enemy or his ass going astray, bring it back to him” (Exod.
xxiii. 4). “Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself
from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother” (Deut. xxii. 1). “Thou
shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself
from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again” (<i>ibid.</i> ver. 4).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.3">3. <i>The Honour of our Fellow-man.</i>—“Let the honour of thy fellow-man be as dear to thee as thy own” (Aboth ii. 10).
We are very sensitive about our own honour; and many of us—nay, all right-minded persons—are
more anxious for the good name acquired through integrity of character than for the
safety of their property. We must be equally sensitive about the honour of our fellow-man,
and take good care lest we damage his repute by falsehood, slander, or spreading evil
reports in apparently innocent gossip. An evil tongue (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לשון הרע‎</span>) is a serious failing from which few are exempt; even if a person is not guilty of
the sin of evil speech, he does not entirely escape “the dust <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>of the evil tongue” (Babyl. Talm. B. Bathra 165<i>a</i>). Calumny, it is said, kills three—the slanderer himself, him who listens, and the
person spoken of. We therefore add to the <i>Amidah</i> the words: “My God, guard my tongue from evil, and my lips from speaking guile;”
and in one of the Psalms we read: “Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days,
that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile”
(Ps. xxxiv. 13, 14).
</p>
<p>Our Sages are very severe against those who attack the honour of their fellow-men.
In one passage it is said: “Whoever causes by offensive words the face of his fellow-man
to turn pale is almost guilty of shedding blood” (Babyl. Talm. B. Metsia 58<i>b</i>). Another passage runs thus: “Rather let a man throw himself into a furnace than
publicly offend his fellow-man” (<i>ibid.</i> 59<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>The Law does not only forbid the utterance of evil reports, but also the encouragement
given to the tale-bearer by listening to his stories. “Thou shalt not take up a false
report” (Exod. xxiii. 1). In the Book of Proverbs the evil consequences of listening
to slander are thus depicted: “If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, all his servants
are wicked” (Prov. xxix. 12). “He who giveth heed to wicked lips causeth evil-doing;
he who giveth ear to a mischievous tongue feedeth lies” (<i>ibid.</i> xvii. 4).
</p>
<p>When we hear evil reports about our neighbour, we should try to defend him; when we
are convinced that he has done wrong, we must rebuke him, lead him back to the right
way, and not utterly reject him; we may still find some redeeming feature in his character
that makes it worth our while to save him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>Thus Joshua, the son of Perachjah, teaches us: “Judge every man favourably” (Aboth
i. 6); that is, if you are uncertain as to a man’s faults, let him have the benefit
of the doubt. When we criticise our neighbour’s character—and idle gossip frequently
leads to this practice—we are too often inclined to dwell upon his weak points—his
vices—and to pass over his merits in silence; but we ought to consider how little
we should like to see the same treatment applied to ourselves. Another fault of ours
is to judge the doings of other people without fully understanding all the circumstances
and the causes that led to such actions. Hillel said, “Do not judge thy neighbour
until thou hast come into his place;” that is, do not pass judgment upon your neighbour
before you are able to place yourself in his position, and to say with certainty what,
you would have done under the same circumstances. The Law forbids us to use divers
weights and divers measures in our business transactions, lest we damage the property
of our neighbour; equally unlawful is the use of one kind of weights and measures
for weighing our own words and deeds, and another kind for weighing the words and
the deeds of others, to the injury of our fellow-man’s name and repute. Contrary to
the usage of courts of justice, our neighbour’s words and deeds are generally reported
by us, interpreted, tried and condemned in his absence, when he is unable to defend
himself, to show his innocence, or to prove the falsehood of the report, the error
of the interpretation, and the injustice of the trial and the condemnation.
</p>
<p>The perversity of such conduct is evident, especially <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>in the case of the departed. The prohibition, “Thou shalt not curse the deaf” (Lev.
xix. 14) has been interpreted to apply to all kinds of slander about those absent
or dead. Our respect for the memory of the dead is expressed in the Latin maxim, “<i lang="la">De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>;” or in the Hebrew, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחרי מות קדשים אמור‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7936src" href="#xd32e7936">12</a> “After their death say of them ‘saints.’ ” Similar maxims are the following: “We
must not refute the lion after his death;” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מיתה מכפרת‎</span> “Death atones for all offences.”
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.4">4. <i>The Well-being of our Fellow-man.</i>—The duties expounded in the above are of a negative character. The commandment, “Love
thy neighbour as thyself<span class="corr" id="xd32e7946" title="Not in source">”</span> implies also certain positive duties, which are comprehended in the terms, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדקה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמלות חסד‎</span> “charity.”
</p>
<p>The literal meaning of the term <i>tsedakah</i> is “righteousness,” but it occurs also frequently in the sense of “charity;” and
we may infer from this that charity was to the Hebrew a mere act of righteousness.
In the Book of Daniel and in post-Biblical Hebrew <i>tsedakah</i> is “alms,” and distinguished from <i>gemilluth-chesed</i>, “charity.” The former is given to the poor; the latter to poor and rich alike: <i>tsedakah</i>, consisting of money or things that can be purchased for money, is a duty chiefly
incumbent on the wealthier class; <i>gemilluth-chesed</i>, consisting of personal acts of kindness, is a virtue that can be acquired and practised
by every one, whether he be poor or rich; and whilst <i>tsedakah</i> can only be given to those that live, <i>gemilluth-chesed</i> can be shown even to the departed. <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>When Jacob asked his son for a burial in the cave of Machpelah, he relied on his son’s
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד ואמת‎</span>, “Kindness and truth;” and the Midrash adds the remark, “Kindness shown to the dead
is an act of true love, as there can be no prospect of gratitude or repayment.”
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.2.5">The principal kinds of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמלות חסד‎</span> are the following:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בקור חולים‎</span> Visiting the sick.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7990src" href="#xd32e7990">13</a> The object of the visit ought to be to cheer up the sufferer by pleasant conversation,
to assist him by good advice, to render him any service that is wanted, to inspire
him with hope, and to strengthen his faith in God by the comforting words of Scripture
and by prayer. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלוית המת‎</span> “Accompanying the dead” to his last resting-place, and doing everything that our
love and regard for the departed requires. Almost every Jewish community includes
an association whose members undertake to perform personally, as far as possible,
these acts of love. Such a society is generally called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חברת גמלות חסדים‎</span> “Association for practising loving-kindness towards our fellow-men,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חברא קדישא‎</span> “Holy Association;” that is, an association for a holy object. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נחום אבלים‎</span> Comforting the mourners, who find relief in the conviction that their fellow-men
have sympathy with them. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הבאת שלום בין אדם לחברו‎</span> “Peace-making.”—War, whether carried on between nations, or between parties, or between
one individual and another, is equally detestable; and all those who by their exertion
and intercession contribute to a diminution of warfare are <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>engaged in praiseworthy work. The principal prayers in our Liturgy conclude with a
petition for peace, and we look forward for the state of uninterrupted peace, the
Messianic time, as the most perfect condition of mankind. Forbearance, a kind word,
a judicious counsel, frequently averts the great evil of strife and enmity.—Peace,
harmony, and friendship are best promoted by— </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5.)</span> Judging favourably the deeds and words of our fellow-men. It is not an easy task
to correctly estimate the motives which guide our neighbour in his actions, and in
doing so we err frequently; but it is better to err by over-estimating them; since
this produces far less harm than going astray in the other direction and speaking
ill of others without any justifiable cause. Conduct like this leads to peace and
happiness within and without. “Speaking peace to all his seed” is the climax of the
virtues praised in Mordecai, the Jew (Esther x. 3). </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Charity (<i>tsedakah</i>) in its narrower sense, as a duty towards the poor, includes—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> Alms-giving to the poor for the purpose of alleviating temporary suffering. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> Providing for the comfort of the aged and sick, widows and orphans. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> Assisting the stranger. The Law lays special stress on this branch of charity, and
reminds us that we all have once been strangers in the land of Egypt. Even in the
various countries of which we have become citizens, our forefathers, three or four
generations back, were strangers; and, besides, we are told by the Almighty, “Ye are
strangers and sojourners <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>with me:” (Lev. xxv. 23). This kind of charity is known by the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הכנסת אורחים‎</span> </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> Support given to the poor towards obtaining a livelihood, by procuring occupation
for them, teaching them a trade and giving them a start in it. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5.)</span> Providing for the religious and secular education of the children of the poor. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(6.)</span> Raising their intellectual, social, and moral condition by personal intercourse with
them, and by kind words of advice, comfort, and encouragement. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(7.)</span> Helping those who have gone astray and have fallen into vice or crime to return to
the path of virtue, industry, and righteousness. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>There are generally associations formed for the various branches of <i>gemilluth-chesed</i>, the number of which grows, especially in large towns, with the increase of misery.
It is our duty to support such institutions, as combined action is in most cases more
practical and productive of good result. But the existence of public institutions,
and our support given to them, by no means exempt us from assisting individually those
who apply to us for help. We must be judicious in our charitable acts, lest we nurse
poverty and promote imposture. But, on the other hand, we must not be over cautious,
and must not unduly suspect every applicant for assistance as guilty of idleness or
other vices, lest by refusal or hesitation to help we become guilty of neglect, when
by prompt action we might save from utter ruin a person or a whole family well worthy
of our sympathy. In this regard we are warned by King Solomon: “Withhold not good
from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of <span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>thine hand to do it. Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to-morrow
I will give; when thou hast it by thee” (Prov. iii. 27, 28).

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.2.3.1" class="first">1. <i>Children towards their Parents.</i>—“<i>Honour thy father and thy mother</i>” is one of the Ten Words which God spoke to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The child
honours his parents by considering them as his superiors, as endowed with authority
over him, and entitled by experience to be his guides and instructors; by listening
respectfully when they speak to him, and by speaking with reverence when he speaks
of or to them.
</p>
<p>The love of parents towards their child should find an echo in the heart of the latter.
</p>
<p>The child’s love of his parents finds expression in willing, cheerful obedience; in
the endeavour to do everything that pleases them, in the sacrifice made for the purpose
of giving them pleasure, in the assistance given them when, through age, sickness,
or misfortune, they are in need of aid.
</p>
<p>The parents’ duty towards the child is to do everything that true love demands, for
his physical, moral, and intellectual well-being.
</p>
<p>With regard to the child’s duty towards his parents the following verses from Proverbs
may be noticed:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens
of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it” (xxx. 17).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, the same
is the companion of a destroyer” (xxviii. 24).
</p>
<p>“Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness”
(xx. 20).
</p>
<p>“He that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame,
and bringeth reproach” (xix. 26).
</p>
<p>“The glory of children are their fathers” (xvii. 6).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>2. All other special duties towards our fellow-men may be divided into (i.) Duties
towards our equals; (ii.) Duties towards our superiors and towards our inferiors.
</p>
</div>

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(i.)</span> <i>Duties towards our Equals.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.1" class="first">(1.) A bond of friendship frequently exists between equals.
</p>
<p>Friends have certain duties to fulfil towards each other. It is expected that friends
should have faith in their mutual friendship. “As in water face answereth to face,
so in the heart man answereth to man” (Prov. xxvii. 19). As the water reflects the
face of him who looks into it, so the heart of man reflects the friendship and faithfulness
of him who has penetrated into it. Our estimation of our friend’s feeling toward us
is the measure of the genuineness and value of our own friendship towards him.
</p>
<p>Disinterestedness is an essential condition of genuine friendship. Every service we
render to our friend must be prompted by the desire to be of use to him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>and not to advance our own interest. If any other motive enters our mind, if we speculate
on his gratitude, and think that our kindness must eventually be returned with interest,
we have no knowledge or feeling of friendship. Thus our Sages declare, “Friendship
dictated by a selfish motive comes to an end together with the speculation; but friendship
which is not based on any selfish motive comes never to an end. An instance of the
first kind is the friendship between Amnon and Tamar (2 Sam. xiii.); of the second
kind, the friendship between David and Jonathan (1 Sam. xviii.)” (Aboth v. 16).
</p>
<p>Friends bound to each other by genuine and sincere love find great pleasure in the
fulfilment of the duties involved in friendship. They do not hesitate to bring sacrifices
for each other’s well-being; they evince heartfelt sympathy for each other in good
and evil fortune.
</p>
<p>All the duties of charity—<i>gemilluth chesed</i>—which we owe to our fellow-men in general, apply with increased force when our fellow-man
is also our friend. One of these duties demands our special attention, because it
is frequently neglected through human weakness: truthfulness and openness. Flattery,
objectionable as it is in every case, is most detestable between friends. We must
encourage our friends by kind words, and acknowledge their merits, but we must not
spoil them by undue flattery. If, on the other hand, we discover errors or vices in
our friend, it is our duty to communicate to him openly our opinion, and to do all
that is in our power to bring him back to the path of righteousness and truth. <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>“Thou shalt surely rebuke thy friend, and not suffer sin upon him” (Lev. xix. 17).
</p>
<p>Friendship is mostly formed without premeditation, and without any aim; we are friends,
we do not know how and why; some similarity in our character, in our talents, in our
views, in our successes and failures, or in our fortunes and misfortunes, draws us
together, and we become friends before we are aware of the fact. But as far as we
have control over our feelings we ought to be careful not to plunge into friendship
without knowing something of the character and the tendencies of those with whom we
are to associate ourselves in such close relationship. In Proverbs we are told, “Make
no friendships with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go” (xxii.
24). Ben-sira (vi. 6) exhorts us, “If thou wouldst get a friend, prove him first,
and be not hasty to credit him.” Our Sages say, “It is easy to make an enemy; it is
difficult to make a friend” (Yalkut on Deut. vi. 16).
</p>
<p>The acquisition of a true friend is by no means an easy task. But it is a task that
cannot be dispensed with. Persons who enjoy a life spent in loneliness uncheered by
friendship are exceptions to the rule; such a life is miserable, and the climax of
all the evils complained of by Heman the Ezrahite (Ps. lxxxviii. 19) is: “Lover and
friend hast thou put far from me, and darkness is mine acquaintance.” Job in his great
sufferings longs for “the love which is shown to the unhappy by his friend” (Job vi.
14).
</p>
<p>Friendship being one of our most valuable possessions, it must be well guarded and
cultivated, lest it be lost or weakened. “Thine own friend and thy <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>father’s friend, forsake not” (Prov. xxvii. 10). “Let thy foot be seldom in thy friend’s
house, lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee” (<i>ibid.</i> xxv. 17).
</p>
<p>True friendship can be extended only to a few; but those who are not our friends need
not be our enemies. They are all our fellow-men, and our conduct towards them is to
be guided by the principle, “Love thy fellow-man as thyself.” We are distinctly commanded,
“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart” (Lev. xix. 18), “brother” having
here the same meaning as fellow-man. Enmity, like friendship, comes frequently unawares;
we dislike or even hate a person without knowing why. But it is our duty, as soon
as such an ill-feeling has stolen into our heart, to search for its origin; and this
being done, we shall generally feel ashamed of having allowed our heart to be invaded
by such an unworthy intruder. We must keep away from evil-doers, and not associate
with wicked people; but this is a very different thing from hating our neighbour.
The pious wish, “May sinners cease to exist, and the wicked be no more” (Ps. civ.
35), is explained in the Talmud in the words of Beruria, daughter of Rabbi Meir, as
follows: “May sins cease to exist, and the wicked will be no more.” We often conceive
just indignation at the misdeeds of our neighbours, and cannot well separate the doer
from the deed. But we ought in such cases of indignation to examine ourselves, whether
the source of our indignation is pure, or has its root in selfishness. Such an analysis
of our motives would soon purify our heart of all ill-feeling.
</p>
<p>In our conduct towards those whom we consider our <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>enemies, or who consider us their enemies, we must show forbearance and a desire to
offer or to seek forgiveness, according as we are the doers or the sufferers of wrong.
Self-love and self-esteem, if not kept within due limits, easily produce feelings
of revenge. Without entirely suppressing human nature, we are bound to control our
feelings, and to let love of our fellow-men in all conditions occupy the first place
in our heart. We are taught by our Sages, “He who is forbearing, receives also pardon
for his sins” (Babyl. Talm. Yoma 23<i>a</i>); “Be of the persecuted, and not of the persecutors” (<i>ibid.</i> Baba Kama 93<i>a</i>); “To those who being offended do not offend, being insulted do not insult, the verse
applies: ‘And they who love him shall be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might’ ”
(Judges v. 31; Babyl. Talm. Shabbath 88<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.2">(2.) <i>Man and wife</i> are united by the holy bond of marriage. They owe to each other love, faithfulness,
confidence, and untiring endeavour to make each other happy. The neglect of these
duties turns a happy home into an abode of misery and wretchedness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8149src" href="#xd32e8149">14</a> The last of the prophets, Malachi, rebuking such neglect, says: “The Lord hath been
witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously,
yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.”
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.3">(3.) As <i>citizens</i> of a State we must take our proper share in all work for the welfare of the State.
When the State is in danger we must evince patriotism, and must not withdraw ourselves
from those duties which, under <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>such circumstances, devolve upon every citizen. All our means, our physical and intellectual
faculties, must be at the disposal of the country in which we live as citizens. Thus
Jeremiah exhorts his brethren in Babylonia: “Build ye houses and dwell in them; and
plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; … and seek the peace of the city whither
I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for
in the peace thereof shall you have peace” (Jer. xxix. 5, 7). Similarly we are taught,
“Pray for the welfare of the government” (Aboth iii. 2).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8160src" href="#xd32e8160">15</a>
</p>
<p>An important dictum of Samuel, a Rabbi famous for his decisions in questions of civil
law, is accepted in the Talmud as law: “The law of the State is binding upon us,”
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דינא דמלכותא דינא‎</span> (Babyl. Talm. Baba Kamma 113<i>a</i>). It is, according to the teaching of the Talmud, incumbent upon us, as citizens
of the State, to obey the laws of the country. There is no difference between Jews
and their fellow-citizens with regard to the duty of loyalty. It is only in case of
an attempt to force us aside from our religion that we are not only justified in resisting
and disobeying laws framed with this intention, but we are commanded to do so. But
in the absence of such intention, we must fulfil all those duties which devolve upon
all citizens alike—such as military service in countries that have general conscription—although
such obedience may carry with it a breach of some of the laws of our religion. On
the contrary, evasion and desertion <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>of all national obligations is a serious offence against our holy Law.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.4">(4.) <i>As members of the same religious community</i>, we must unite in working for the well-being of the whole body. “Do not separate
thyself from the congregation” (Aboth ii. 4) is a principle taught by the great Hillel.
A Jew who violates this principle, and keeps aloof from his brethren, unwilling to
take his share of the communal burdens, is guilty of a serious dereliction of duty,
and is set forth in the Talmud as an example of most disgraceful conduct. “When your
brethren are in trouble, do not say, ‘I have my home, my food and drink; I am safe.’
If you ever were to think so, the words of the prophet would apply to you: ‘Surely
this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you die<span class="corr" id="xd32e8179" title="Not in source">’</span>.” “He who does not join the community in times of danger and trouble will never enjoy
the Divine blessing” (Babyl. Talm. Taanith, p. 11<i>a</i>); “He who separates from the ways of the community has no portion of the world to
come,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הפורש מדרכי צבור אין לו חלק לעולם הבא‎</span> (Maim., Mishneh-torah, Hilchoth Teshubah iii. 6).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.5">(5.) <i>As to members of another community</i>, we have to show due regard for their religious convictions, and not to wound their
feelings in respect of anything they hold sacred. Respect for the religious feelings
of our fellow-men will increase their regard for our own religion, and evoke in them
the same consideration for our religious feelings. All our duties towards our fellow-men
are equally binding upon us whether in relation to members of ether faiths or of our
own.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.2.6">(6.) <i>Employers and employed, sellers and buyers</i>, must act towards each other with the strictest honesty. In cases of dispute a friendly
explanation or discussion is more likely to promote the interest of both parties than
mutual animosity. Each party must bear in mind that prosperity depends on the co-operation
of the other party, and not on its ruin.
</p>
<p class="small"><span class="sc">Note.</span>—We meet in the Talmud and works based on the Talmud with dicta which seem at first
sight to exclude Gentiles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עכו״ם‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נכרי‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גוי‎</span>) from our duty of love towards our fellow-men. This, however, was never intended.
Sayings of this kind originated in days of warfare between the oppressor and the oppressed,
and were an outburst of feelings of pain and anger, caused by an enemy who was not
restrained from tyranny and cruelty by any sense of justice and humanity. But this
state of affairs has ceased, and such sayings have since entirely lost their force
and meaning, and are practically forgotten. Some of these passages have been removed
from the Talmudical works by hostile censors; but having led, and being still likely
to lead, to errors or misunderstanding, less on the part of Jews than of non-Jewish
readers, they ought to be eliminated in future editions of any of these works by Jewish
censors, especially as the notices on the first page of the books, that the terms
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גוי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עכו״ם‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נכרי‎</span> do not apply to our non-Jewish neighbours at the present day, appear to have proved
ineffectual against calumny and persecution.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although we are all equally children of one God, and before the Most High all our
petty differences disappear, His infinite wisdom willed it that there should be a
certain degree of inequality among His creatures; that some men should be wise, others
simple; some talented, others less skilful; some strong, others weak; some high, others
low; some imperious, others <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>submissive; some rulers, others subjects; some fit to guide, and others only fit to
be guided. This inequality is the source of certain special duties between man and
man. “Be submissive to your superior, agreeable to your inferior, and cheerful to
every one” (Aboth iii. 12).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.3.1">(1.) The teacher who patiently strives to benefit his pupils by his instruction and
counsel has a just claim on their respect. It is in the interest of the pupils themselves
to regard their teacher as a friend, to have confidence in him, and faith in his superiority.
It is themselves they benefit most if they lighten the labours of their teacher by
due attention and obedience, and themselves they injure most, if by want of proper
respect they render his task difficult and disagreeable.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is the duty of the teacher to try to win the respect and the
affection of the pupils by conscientiousness in his work, by patience and forbearance,
by kindness and justice, by genuine interest in the progress and welfare of those
entrusted to his care, and, above all, by a pure, good, and noble life.—The pupils
owe much to their teachers, but the latter also owe something to their disciples.
“Much have I learnt from my teachers, more from my fellow-students, most from my pupils,”
is a well-known Talmudical saying (Babyl. Talm. Taanith 7<i>a</i>). Of the priest, who in ancient time used to be the principal teacher, the prophet
Malachi says: “The priest’s lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law
at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts” (Mal. ii. 7). Rabbi Jochanan,
in commenting <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>on these words, said, “If the teacher is like the messenger of the Lord, <i>i.e.</i>, leads a pure life in the service of the Lord, then people shall seek instruction
at his mouth; if not, they cannot be instructed by him in the Law” (Yalkut <i>ad locum</i>).—“Let the honour of thy disciple be as dear to thee as thy own, and the honour of
thy colleague as dear as the fear of thy teacher, and the fear of thy teacher as dear
as the fear of Heaven” (Aboth iv. 15).—“He who has been taught something by his neighbour,
whether it be a chapter, a law, a verse, a phrase, or a letter, owes him respect.
Thus David, who only learnt two things from Ahitophel, called him ‘teacher, chief,
and friend’ ” (<i>ibid.</i> vi. 3).
</p>
<p>Reverence is shown by a pupil to his teacher, not only by outward signs of respect,
but also by refraining from opposing him, his teaching, or his decisions (Maimonides
I. Hilchoth Talmud torah v. 1). A pupil who altogether relinquishes the teaching of
his master is to the latter a source of intense grief.—Among the outward signs of
regard for the teacher we find the ancient custom or rule to pay a visit to the teacher
on the three festivals: Passover, Feast of Weeks, and Tabernacles (<i>ibid.</i> v. 7).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.3.2">(2.) <i>Master and Servant.</i>—The relation between master and servant is legally regulated by the same rules as
that between employer and employed. Strict honesty in the fulfilment of the duties
undertaken by either party is the basis of a good understanding between master and
servant. The former must not exact from the latter more than was agreed upon, and
the latter must not fail to perform all that he has undertaken <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>to do. The relation between master and servant can be made more pleasant on both sides,
if they are sensible enough to recognise their mutual obligations. On the part of
the master, it is necessary that he should consider his servant as a human being like
himself, who has a right to expect due reward for faithful service. A treatment of
the servant from this point of view inspires him with a feeling of regard and attachment
for his master, which finds expression in good and honest service. The servant will
feel comfortable in his work, and be convinced that to be a servant is no degradation.—“Thou
shalt not defraud an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren
or of thy strangers that are in the land within thy gates” (Deut. xxiv. 14).
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.3.3">(3.) <i>Rich and Poor.</i>—“The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all” (Prov. xxii.
2). Those who are fortunate enough to possess more than is wanted for the necessities
of life, are expected to spend part of the surplus in relieving those who possess
less than they require for their maintenance. Sympathy towards the poor and needy
is the duty of the rich; gratitude towards the generous and benevolent is the duty
of the poor. But the rich must by no means make their gifts dependent on the signs
of gratitude on the part of the poor; they must even avoid eliciting expressions of
thanks, as these lead too often to flattery, hypocrisy, and servility. The rich find
ample reward for their benevolence in the joyous feeling that Providence has chosen
them as the means of diminishing the sufferings, the troubles, and the cares of some
of their fellow-men<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.2.3.3.4">(4.) The following have a just claim on our respect:—
</p>
<p><i>Learned Men</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תלמידי חכמים‎</span>), who, even if not directly our teachers, in many ways benefit us by their learning.
“It is a great sin to despise or to hate the wise: Jerusalem has chiefly been destroyed
as a punishment for the contempt shown for the learned; as it is said (2 Chron. xxxvi.
16), ‘They mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,
until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy’ ” (Maimonides,
<i>l. c.</i> vi. 11). “He who despises <i>talmide-chachamim</i>,” says Rab, “has no remedy for his disease” (Babyl. Talm. Shabbath, 119<i>b</i>), and belongs to those who forfeit their portion in the world to come (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין להם חלק לעולם הבא‎</span>, <i>ibid.</i>, Sanhedrin 90).
</p>
<p><i>The Aged.</i>—“Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and
fear thy God” (Lev. xix. 32). The Bible illustrates, in the history of Rehoboam (1
Kings xii.), the evil consequences of the contempt shown by this king to the words
of the old men.—“With the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days understanding”
(Job xii. 12). “The building of the young is destruction; the destruction of the old
is building” (B.&nbsp;T. Megillah 31<i>b</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8284src" href="#xd32e8284">16</a>
</p>
<p><i>Great men</i> who have accomplished great works in the interest of mankind, and have thus merited
the gratitude of all.
</p>
<p><i>The great men of our nation</i>, their works and the institutions founded by them at various periods of our <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>history. “Do not despise thy mother, though she hath become old” (Prov. xxiii. 22).
The feeling of piety and reverence towards our Sages and Teachers of former generations,
and towards institutions of ancient times that have come down to us, is an essential
element in our inner religion (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חובות הלבבות‎</span>).
</p>
<p><i>The magistrates, judges, and statesmen</i>, who devote their time, their talents, and their energy to promoting the well-being
of the State.
</p>
<p><i>The Head of the State.</i>—“Fear the Lord, O my son, and the king, and do not mix with rioters” (Prov. xxiv.
21).

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>c.</i>)</span> <i>Kindness to Animals.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
that moveth upon the earth” (Gen. i. 28 and ix. 2, &amp;c.; comp. Ps. viii. 7, &amp;c.). Thus
spake the Creator to the first man. He gave him a right to make use of the animals
for his benefit; and man makes the animals work for him; they serve him as food, provide
him with clothing and other necessary or useful things. In return for all these services
the animals ought to be treated with kindness and consideration. It is a necessity
to force certain beasts to work for us, and to kill certain animals for various purposes.
But in doing so we must not cause more pain than is absolutely necessary. It is a
disgraceful act to give pain to animals merely for sport, and to enjoy their agony.
Bullfights and similar spectacles are barbarous, and tend to corrupt and brutalise
<span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>the heart of man. The more we abstain from cruelty to animals, the more noble and
loving is our conduct likely to be to one another. “A righteous man regardeth the
feelings of his beast, but the heart of the wicked is cruel” (Prov. xii. 10).
</p>
<p>The following are instances of kindness to animals enjoined in the Pentateuch:—
</p>
<p>“Ye shall not kill an animal and its young on one day” (Lev. xxii. 28).
</p>
<p>“If a bird’s nest happen to be before thee on the way upon the earth or upon a tree,
with young ones or eggs, thou shalt not take the mother with the young. Let the mother
go away; then thou mayest take the young ones, in order that it may be well with thee,
and thy days be long” (Deut. xxii. 6, 7).
</p>
<p>“Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn” (<i>ibid.</i> xxv. 4).
</p>
<p>In the Talmud we have the following saying in the name of Rab:—“We must not begin
our meal before having given food to our cattle; for it is said, ‘And I will give
you grass in thy field for thy cattle,’ and after that ‘thou shalt eat and be full’ ”
(Deut. xi. 15; Babyl. Talm. 40<i>a</i>).

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">C.—</span><i>Duties to Ourselves.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our duties to ourselves are to a great extent included in our duties towards God and
towards our fellow-men, because these likewise tend to promote our own well-being.
</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of our duties towards <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>ourselves is to make the best use of the gifts which the kindness of God has bestowed
upon us.
</p>
<p>1. <i>Life and health</i> are precious gifts received by us at the hands of Divine Providence. We must therefore
guard them as valuable treasures, and must not endanger them without absolute necessity.
On the contrary, as much as lies in our power, we must improve our health and preserve
our life. Food and bodily enjoyment, however pleasant for the moment, must be let
alone if they are injurious to health. If we find ourselves inclined to exceed the
right measure in the enjoyment of a thing, it is advisable to turn, for a while at
least, to the other extreme and avoid that enjoyment altogether. Thus persons that
are easily misled to excess in drink should become total abstainers from drink. But
in ordinary cases the golden mean is preferable, especially for us Jews who are trained
by the Dietary Laws, and by other precepts, to have control over our appetites. We
are not commanded to be ascetics and to lead a gloomy, miserable life. On the contrary,
we are frequently told in the Pentateuch, “And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your
God.” The Psalmist exhorts us to “serve the Lord with gladness; to come before his
presence with singing” (Ps. c. 2). “He who doeth good to his own soul is a man of
love; and he who troubleth his own flesh is a cruel man” (Prov. xi. 17); <i>i.e.</i>, he who does good to himself is of a cheerful disposition, and is likely to do good
to others; but he who deprives himself of enjoyments is often also cruel to his fellow-creatures.
The Nazirite had to bring a sin-offering after the expiration of the period of his
<span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>vow. “What sin has he committed?” was asked. The answer is given in the Talmud by
Samuel: “Because he deprived himself of wine;” and the Rabbi further infers from this,
that it is prohibited to impose a voluntary fast upon oneself. Rabbi Eleazar, however,
thinks that the vow of a Nazirite is a praiseworthy act, and his view found many followers,
especially in the Middle Ages. Abraham Ibn Ezra, <i>e.g.</i>, explains that the sin of the Nazirite consists in not prolonging the state of Naziritism.
But, however different their opinions may be theoretically, all agree that no voluntary
fast should be undertaken, if it endangers the health of the faster, changes cheerfulness
into sadness, and disables him from doing necessary or useful work.
</p>
<p>2. <i>Wealth</i>, if acquired in an honest manner, by hard work, is conducive to our well-being. But
in our search for wealth we must bear in mind that it is not an end in itself, but
serves only as a means of securing our well-being. Koheleth tells us, what experience
endorses, that there are “riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt” (Eccles.
v. 12). It is true we must struggle for the means of our existence. But in the struggle
for wealth we must not entirely suppress the claims of our moral and intellectual
wants, and if we were to suppress them, we should only work for our own ruin. “Two
things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: Remove far from me
vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient
for me: lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor,
and steal, <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>and take the name of my God in vain” (Prov. xxx. 7–9). To this golden mean we should
adhere. It is our duty to seek an honest livelihood, but we are told, “Labour not
to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom” (Prov. xxiii. 4). One of the various duties
of parents towards their children is to take good care that they learn a trade, and
“he who does not teach his son a trade,” say our Sages, “is as guilty as if he directly
taught him to rob” (Babyl. Talm. Kiddushin, p. 29<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>There is an erroneous opinion abroad, that commerce is more congenial to Judaism than
handicraft. In our Law no trace of such preference is noticeable; on the contrary,
agriculture was the principal occupation of the Israelites. “When thou eatest the
labour of thine hands, happy art thou, and it is well with thee” (Ps. cxxviii. 2).
“Love work, and hate lordship” is a well-known lesson of the sayings of the Fathers
(Aboth i. 10). Bible and post-Biblical literature equally teach us the lesson that
our comfort and happiness do not depend on the amount of wealth we have amassed, but
on the degree of contentment our heart has acquired. “Sweet is the sleep of the labourer,
whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
sleep” (Eccles. v. 11).
</p>
<p>Industry is one of the sources of human happiness; but the blessing of industry is
easily lost, if it is not combined with thrift and temperance. In days of prosperity
we must bear in mind that days of misfortune may come; we must, so far as we can,
provide for them, so that we may be able to hold out “till the storm has passed.”
Temperance is inseparable from thrift <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>and industry. Intemperance not only consumes the products of thrift and industry,
but in course of time destroys these very sources of our prosperity. Even with regard
to Sabbath, in honour of which some degree of comfort and even of luxury may be indulged
in, the principle is laid down: “Treat thy Sabbath like an ordinary day, if additional
expense is likely to make thee dependent on charity” (Babyl. Talm. Shabbath 118<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>3. <i>Knowledge.</i>—God has made man “a little lower than the angels, and has crowned him with glory
and honour” (Ps. viii. 6); He has endowed him with the faculty of acquiring knowledge:
“There is a spirit in man, and an inspiration of the Almighty, that gives him understanding”
(Job xxxii. 8). It is our duty to cultivate this faculty, to nurse it with all possible
care, that it may grow, produce beautiful blossoms, and bear goodly fruit. The training
must begin very early, at an age in which we are entirely dependent on the assistance
and guidance of others. Parents, to whom the Almighty has entrusted the care of their
children, are therefore commanded to provide for their education; and as parents are
not always capable of doing this, the duty devolves on the community or on the State.
Every civilised country has its schools, colleges, and seminaries for the development
of the intellectual and moral faculties of its inhabitants, and as these institutions
increase in number and efficiency, the prosperity of the nation grows in like proportion.
But the success of these educational institutions, however well provided they may
be with an excellent teaching staff and the best appliances, depends on the regular
and punctual attendance of the children, their attention, <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>and their industry. It is the duty of parents to see, as far as it is in their power,
that these conditions be fulfilled. Among the various branches of knowledge we seek
to acquire, there is one branch of paramount importance, the absence of which would
make all other knowledge valueless: it is—
</p>
<p>4. <i>Moral and Religious Training.</i>—“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and correction”
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה ומוסר‎</span> Prov. i. 7). The author of the Book of Proverbs teaches that knowledge must be combined
with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יראת השם‎</span> “fear of God;” and that it is a perverse idea to separate wisdom (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>) from moral training (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוסר‎</span>), and to seek <span class="corr" id="xd32e8387" title="Source: knowlege">knowledge</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דעת‎</span>) without the fear of the Lord (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יראת ה׳‎</span>). Our Sages teach us that our training should include both fear of God and wisdom.
“If there is no wisdom, there is no fear of God; and in the absence of the latter
there is no wisdom” (Aboth iii. 17). Fear of the Lord, however, and fear of sin must
have precedence. <span id="xd32e8396"></span>Rabbi Chanina, son of Dosa, says: “If a man’s wisdom is preceded by fear of sin, his
wisdom is well established; if the fear of sin is preceded by wisdom, his wisdom is
not well established” (<i>ibid.</i> 9).
</p>
<p>The result of our training must be the acquisition of good manners and noble principles.
Avoid extremes, and hold to the golden mean, is an excellent rule that leads us safely
through the various conditions of life and wards off many troubles and dangers. The
following examples may serve as an illustration of this rule: Do not ignore your own
self; let self-love and self-respect influence your conduct; but these must not be
allowed to develop into selfishness <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>and arrogance. Look after your own interests, but do not consider them as the supreme
rulers of your actions. Be self-reliant, and keep equally far from self-conceit and
self-distrust. Haughtiness and self-contempt are extremes to be avoided: be modest.
When wronged or insulted by your neighbour, be neither callous nor over-sensitive;
ignore insult and wrong in most cases, forgive them readily in others, and resent
them only when forced to do so. In disputes and discussions be neither weak nor obstinate:
be firm. Be neither passionate nor indifferent: be calm. Do not trust every one, lest
your credulity mislead you; do not suspect every one, lest you become misanthropic:
be discreet. Do not seek danger, nor fear it; but be prepared to meet it with courage.
Be temperate in eating and drinking, and avoid both excess and needless privation.
In spending your earnings show neither niggardliness nor recklessness: be economical.
Work, but not in such a manner as to ruin your health. As to your future, be neither
too sanguine in your hopes, nor despondent: do your duty, and trust in God.
</p>
<p>There are, however, exceptions from this rule; for in certain cases there is only
the choice between two extremes. Such is <i>Truthfulness</i>. It is our duty to approach nearer and nearer the extreme of this virtue, and to
consider the least deviation from it as vice. From our earliest youth we should train
ourselves in the practice of this virtue. Every word that we desire to utter should
be well examined before it passes our lips. We must be on our guard that nothing should
escape our lips that is not in harmony with what we <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>feel or think. In small matters as well as in important things truthfulness must be
the principle which guides us in our utterances. “The lips of truth shall be established
for ever, but for a moment only the tongue of falsehood” (Prov. xii. 19). “Keep thee
far from a word of falsehood” (Exod. xxiii. 7). “Falsehood,” say our Sages, “has no
legs to stand upon; whilst ‘truth’ is declared to be the seal of the Holy One, Blessed
be He” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמת חותמו של הקב״ה‎</span>).
</p>
<p>Our moral and religious training is based on the Word of God, on the Torah, and the
study of the Torah, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלמוד תורה‎</span>, is an essential element in Jewish education. The term <i>Torah</i> is to be understood in no narrow sense, but as including the written and the oral
Law, all the books of the Holy Writings, and such works as have from time to time
been composed for the purpose of facilitating and promoting the study of the Torah.
The importance of this duty has been recognised from ancient times, and Jewish congregations,
before building a synagogue, made provision for the religious education of the young
and for the study of the Law, by establishing schools and colleges (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית ספר‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בי רב‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית המדרש‎</span>).
</p>
<p><i>Talmud-torah</i> is one of those duties to which no measure was fixed (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשר אין להם שיעור‎</span> Mishnah Peah i. 1). Whenever we can find time and leisure, we ought to turn to the
Word of God, every one according to his capacity and his opportunities. The readings
from the Torah, both the written and the oral, which form part of our Service, have
been introduced for the purpose of facilitating for the general public the fulfilment
of the duty of Talmud-torah.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>The study of the Law and the regular and punctual attendance at the Beth-hammidrash
belong to those religious acts which “bear fruit here on earth and procure bliss in
the future life” (<i>ibid.</i>). Our Sages exhort us in various sayings to devote ourselves earnestly to the study
of the Torah. The object of this study is, in the first instance, to enable us to
live in accordance with His Commandments; secondly, to purify our thoughts by turning
them from common, ordinary things to higher and loftier subjects; for while we are
reading the Divine messages and reflecting on them, we move in a purer atmosphere
and must be inspired with holy and noble thoughts.
</p>
<p>The book which is expected to produce these results must be approached “with awe,
with meekness, with cheerfulness, and with purity” (Aboth vi. 6). Our intention must
be to be instructed and guided by what we read. We must not presume to criticise the
Divine decrees therein recorded. If we meet with passages that strike us as strange
or objectionable, we may be sure that we have not yet comprehended the true sense
of the Divine words. Modesty must cause us rather to assume shortcomings on our part
than to find fault with the Holy Writings. “Turn it over, and read it again and again;
for all is in it, and behold everything through it; and even when old and weak, cleave
to it, and do not move away from it; for there is no better guide for thee than this
one” (Aboth v. 22). There is one great advantage in the study of the Torah; it constantly
supplies us with one of the best means of promoting our moral training, viz., with
good company.
</p>
<p>The society in which we move and the persons <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>with whom we associate are an important factor in the formation of our character.
Bad companions corrupt us, and lead us to ruin; good companions improve our moral
conduct by their example and not rarely by their words. “If one joins mockers, he
will be a mocker; if he joins the lowly, he will show grace” (Prov. iii. 34). “Keep
away from a bad neighbour; do not associate with the wicked, and do not believe thyself
safe from evil” (Aboth i. 7). In our daily prayers we ask God for His assistance in
our endeavour to act according to this principle.
</p>
<p>The aim and end of all our moral training must be to keep our mind pure from evil
thoughts, to make our heart the seat of noble and lofty desires; to accustom our tongue
to the utterance of that which is good and true, and to lead a pure, honourable, and
godly life. If we succeed, we establish our well-being during our life on earth, and
secure Divine blessing for our soul in the future world.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">III.</span> <span class="sc">Signs as Outward Reminders of God’s Presence.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The voice that comes from within, from our own heart and conscience, is the best reminder
of God’s Presence and Will. But it does not always sound with sufficient force to
make itself heard, and we, weak mortals, have the weakness of forgetting even most
important duties, unless we are reminded of them from time to time. The Divine Law
has therefore set up signs as outward reminders. Such are the commandments of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ציצת‎</span> “fringe,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלין‎</span> “ornaments,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזוזה‎</span> “door-post symbol.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.3.1"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ציצת‎</span> <i>“Fringe” or “Tassel.”</i>
</p>
<p>“Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four corners of thy vesture, wherewith thou
coverest thyself” (Deut. xxii. 12). The object of this commandment is described as
follows:—“It shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember
all the commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that ye seek not after your own
heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and
do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God” (Num. xv. 39, 40).
</p>
<p>In obedience to this commandment, we have two kinds of four-cornered garments provided
with “fringes.” The one is small, and is worn under the upper garments the whole day;
it is called <i>arba’ kanfoth</i>, “four corners,” or <i>talith katan</i>, “small scarf.” The other and larger one is worn over the garments during the Morning
Service.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8479src" href="#xd32e8479">17</a> It is called simply <i>talith</i>, “scarf,” or <i>talith gadol</i>, “large scarf.”
</p>
<p>The form of the blessing which accompanies the performance of this <i>mitsvah</i> varies according as it refers to the small <i>talith</i> or to the large one. In the former case the blessing concludes with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על מצות ציצת‎</span> “concerning the commandment of <i>tsitsith</i>;” in the latter with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏להתעטף בציצת‎</span>, “to wrap ourselves with a garment provided with <i>tsitsith</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8511src" href="#xd32e8511">18</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb330a">[<a href="#pb330a">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>tsitsith</i>, which is appended to each of the four corners, consists of four long threads drawn
through a small hole about an inch from the corner; the two parts of the threads are
bound together by a double knot; the largest thread—called <i>shammash</i>, “the servant”—is then wound seven, eight, eleven, and thirteen times round the other
seven halves of the four threads, and after each set of windings a double knot is
made.—If one of the four <i>tsitsith</i> is not in order, <i>e.g.</i>, two of the threads being torn off, the <i>talith</i> is called <i>pasul</i>, “disqualified” for the <i>mitsvah</i>, and must not be worn till that <i>tsitsith</i> is replaced by a new one.
</p>
<p>There is, however, an important element in this Divine commandment, which is now altogether
neglected, viz., “And they shall put upon the fringe of the corner a thread of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תכלת‎</span> purple blue wool” (Num. xv. 38). Tradition determined the exact shade of the purple
blue indicated by the term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תכלת‎</span>; in the Talmud (Menachoth 42<i>b</i>) the various ways of its preparation are given. But the colour seems to have been
rare, and we are warned against using imitations of <i>techeleth</i>. Regulations were also made providing <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>for the case when <i>techeleth</i> could not be obtained. The natural white colour was then substituted, and no other
colour was allowed. After the conclusion of the Talmud doubts seem to have arisen
as regards the exact shade of the purple blue demanded by the Divine precept in the
term <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תכלת‎</span>, and thus the use of the thread of purple blue wool gradually ceased to form part
of the <i>tsitsith</i>. The exact time when it ceased cannot be fixed.

</p>
<p>Four times the Law repeats the commandment concerning the <i>tefillin</i>: “And thou shalt bind them”—the words of God—“for a sign upon thy hand, and they
shall be for a frontlet between thine eyes” (Deut. vi. 8 and xi. 18); “And it shall
be unto thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, in order
that the Law of the Lord be in thy mouth” (Exod. xiii. 9); “And it shall be for a
sign upon thy hand, and for a frontlet between thine eyes” (<i>ibid.</i> 16).
</p>
<p>The object of this commandment is to direct our thoughts to God and His goodness,
and to remind us of the important lessons taught in the following four paragraphs,
in which the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> is mentioned:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1.)</span> The first paragraph (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדש‎</span> Exod. xiii. 1–10) teaches <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>that we must, in various ways, express our belief in God as the King and Ruler of
the universe. Two laws are contained in this paragraph which are to serve this object—the
sanctification of the first-born to the service of the Lord, and the celebration of
the Feast of Unleavened Cakes. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2.)</span> The second paragraph (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏והיה כי יביאך‎</span> Exod. xiii. 11–16) reminds us of the wonderful way in which God delivered our forefathers
from Egyptian bondage. Remembering this deliverance, we are strengthened in our faith
in God in days of trouble, for His ways are not ours, and when <i>we</i> do not see any prospect of relief God may be preparing help for us. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3.)</span> The third paragraph (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמע‎</span> Deut. vi. 4–9) proclaims the Unity of God, and teaches us to love God and obey Him
out of love. </li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4.)</span> The fourth paragraph (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏והיה אם שמע‎</span> Deut. xi. 13–20) teaches that Providence deals with men according to their merits,
according as each deserves reward or punishment. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Tradition has handed down to us the way in which this precept is to be carried out.
The four above-mentioned paragraphs are written twice on parchment, once on one piece,
and once on four pieces, each piece containing one paragraph. The two sets are put
into two leather cases (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span>), one of which is divided into four compartments, for the four separate slips of
parchment, and marked outside by the letter <i>shin</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8659src" href="#xd32e8659">20</a> Through <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>a loop attached to each <i>bayith</i> a leather strap (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רצועה‎</span>) is passed, the two parts of which are tied together<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8688src" href="#xd32e8688">21</a> in such a manner as to hold the <i>bayith</i> on the arm or on the head. On the arm the case is placed that contains the four paragraphs
written on one piece, on the head that which contains them written on four pieces.
The former is called <i>tefillah shel yad</i>, “tefillin of the hand;” the latter <i>tefillah shel rosh</i>, “the tefillin of the head.”
</p>
<p>The <i>tefillin</i> are put on in the following way:—(1.) <i>Tefillah shel rosh</i>. The case is placed in front, just over the forehead in the middle, and the knot
of the straps (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קשר‎</span>) on the back of the head over the middle of the neck; the remainder of the two straps
hang down in front, one on each side. (2.) <i>Tefillah shel yad.</i> The case containing the parchment is placed on the inner side of the left upper arm,
near the elbow; the knot is kept near it, and the strap is twisted seven times round
the arm and three times round the middle finger; there are, however, different customs
with regard to this latter practice.
</p>
<p><i>Tefillah shel yad</i> is put on first, being mentioned first in the Divine precept. The reverse order is
observed in taking off the <i>tefillin</i>. Originally the <i>tefillin</i> were worn all day long,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8733src" href="#xd32e8733">22</a> but at present they are worn only during the morning prayer.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>tefillin</i> are not worn on Sabbath or Festival. The observance of these days is “a sign for
ever” of our belief “that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth.” The
very days of rest thus remind us of the truths of which the <i>tefillin</i> are “a sign.” The <i>tefillin</i> became, therefore, unnecessary on those days.
</p>
<p>The commandment of <i>tefillin</i> applies to all male persons from their thirteenth birthday.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8766src" href="#xd32e8766">23</a>
</p>
<p>The performance of this commandment is preceded by the usual benediction (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת המצות‎</span>), concluding <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏להניח תפלין‎</span>, “to place the <i>tefillin</i>,” <i>scil.</i>, on the arm and on the head. According to the German rite, a second benediction is
recited before placing the <i>tefillah shel rosh</i> on the head, viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על מצות תפלין‎</span>, “concerning the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8793src" href="#xd32e8793">24</a>
</p>
<p>In order to prevent a mere perfunctory observance of this commandment, we are taught
to reflect on the importance and the object of the <i>tefillin</i>, and to declare that by placing the <i>tefillin</i> on the head and on the arm, near the heart, we indicate our consciousness of the
duty to employ the thoughts that rise in our mind, and the desires of our heart, in
the service of the Lord, who gave us the powers of thought and will.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8802src" href="#xd32e8802">25</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.3.3"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזוּזה‎</span> <i>Door-post Symbol.</i>
</p>
<p>The <i>Mezuzah</i> is a piece of parchment on which the two first paragraphs of <i>Shema</i> (Deut. vi. 4–9, xi. 13–20) are written. The parchment is rolled together, put into
a small case, and fixed on the right-hand door-post. A small opening is left in the
case, where the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׁדַּי‎</span> “Almighty,” written on the back of the scroll, is visible.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8822src" href="#xd32e8822">26</a>
</p>
<p>The object of the <i>mezuzah</i>, commanded in the words, “And thou shalt write them on the door-posts of thy house
and upon thy gates” (Deut. vi. 9 and xi. 20), is to remind us of the Presence of God,
of His Unity, Providence, and Omnipotence, both on entering our home and on leaving
it; of the all-seeing eye that watches us, and of the Almighty who will one day call
us to account for our deeds, words and thoughts. The <i>mezuzah</i> thus serves to sanctify our dwelling and protect it from being polluted by evil deeds.
</p>
<p><i>Signs of God’s Covenant.</i>
</p>
<p>Besides the signs mentioned above, there are two other signs of the covenant between
God and Israel.
</p>
<p>1. Sabbath is called “an everlasting covenant,” and “a sign between God and the children
of Israel for ever” (Exod. xxxi. 16, 17). See pp. 254 <i>sqq.</i> and 339 <i>sqq.</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.3.4">2. The covenant of Abraham (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברית מילה‎</span> “the covenant of circumcision”). God made a covenant with Abraham, and said, “Thou
shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is
my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every
male child among you shall be circumcised when eight days old” (Gen. xvii. 9, 10,
12). If the eighth day happens to be on a Sabbath, the circumcision takes place on
that day; but if, because of illness, or from any other cause, the rite has not been
performed on the eighth day, it must be done on some other day, but not on a Sabbath
or Festival.
</p>
<p id="ch2.3.5" class="small"><span class="sc">Notes.</span>—1. In reference to the importance of these <i>mitsvoth</i>, Maimonides, in Mishneh-torah, says as follows:—
</p>
<p class="small">“Although we are not commanded to get a <i>talith</i>, and to put it on in order to join the <i>tsitsith</i> (“fringes”) to it, a religious person will not consider himself free from this duty,
but will always endeavour to wear a garment to which fringes must be affixed. During
prayer we must be especially careful to provide ourselves with a <i>talith</i>. It is a disgrace for a scholar (<i>Talmid chacham</i>) to say the prayer without the <i>talith</i>. We must be particularly anxious to perform this <i>mitsvah</i>; it is of great importance with regard to all the precepts, according to the words,
‘And ye shall look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord’ ” (2nd
Book, <i>Ahabhah</i>, <i>Hilchoth tsitsith</i> iii. 12).
</p>
<p class="small">“The holiness of the <i>tefillin</i> is great, for so long as the <i>tefillin</i> are upon the head and the arm of a man, he is humble and God-fearing, keeps away
from levity and idle talk, does not conceive evil thoughts, but turns his heart exclusively
to words of truth and justice. We ought therefore to wear them all day long; this
would be the proper way. It is said of Rab, the pupil of Rabbi Jehudah, the Holy,
that he was never seen otherwise than with <i>torah</i> or <i>tsitsith</i> or <i>tefillin</i>.
</p>
<p class="small">“Although we ought to wear <i>tefillin</i> all day long, it is our special duty to wear them during prayer. Our Sages said,
‘He who <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>reads <i>Shema</i> without <i>tefillin</i> rejects, as it were, his evidence concerning the Almighty as false’ ” (ibid., <i>Hilchoth tefillin</i> iv. 26).
</p>
<p class="small">“We should be particular with regard to the <i>mezuzah</i>, which is a duty incumbent uninterruptedly on every one. Whenever we enter or leave
the house our eye meets with the name of God; we remember His love, and rousing ourselves
from our torpitude, we are led to regret our foolish devotion to the vanities of the
time, and recognise that nothing remains for ever except the knowledge of the Rock
of the universe. We shall then at once devote ourselves to know Him, and walk in the
way of uprightness. Our ancient Sages said, ‘He who has <i>tefillin</i> upon his head and upon his arm, <i>tsitsith</i> on his garment, and <i>mezuzah</i> on his door, he is safe from sin, since he has many reminders of his duties, and
these are the angels that protect him from going astray; and to him the following
verse applies: “An angel of the Lord encampeth round those who fear Him” ’ ” (ibid.,
<i>Hilchoth mezuzah</i> vi. 13).
</p>
<p class="small">2. The great importance of the <i>tefillin</i>, as described by Maimonides, was not understood or recognised by all Jews. Various
sayings occurring in the Talmud indicate the existence of laxity or even opposition
with regard to the carrying out of this precept in its literal sense. When persons
with <i>tefillin</i> on their head and on their arm showed by their conduct that their heart was not filled
with the holiness and uprightness of which the <i>tefillin</i> are the symbol, it was but natural that not only were these persons accused of hypocrisy,
but the Divine precept itself was discredited. But the greater the opposition by one
section of the Jewish community, the more the enthusiasm of the other section grew
in its favour. Hence the numerous Talmudical and Rabbinical utterances concerning
the sanctifying force inherent in the <i>tefillin</i> (comp. <i>Tur Orach Chayyim</i> xxxvii.). Thus, when a Rabbi was cautioned not to be over joyous, as excess of joy
led to sin, he replied, “I lay <i>tefillin</i>;” <i>i.e.</i>, “The thoughts which the observance of this precept awakens protects me from sin.”
This idea of protection from sin may be the origin of the Greek name <i>phylacterion</i>, “protection.”—In times of persecution, when the Jews were forbidden by their oppressors
to perform any of their religious rites on penalty of death, the precept of <i>tefillin</i> was not included among those which they performed even at the risk of their life.
To this circumstance Rabbi Simeon b. Elazar ascribes the laxity with regard to the
<i>tefillin</i> (Babyl. Talm. Shabbath 130<i>a</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span></p>
<p class="small">3. There occurs in the Midrash (Sifre on Deut. xi. 18), in reference to <i>tsitsith</i> and <i>tefillin</i>, the following passage: “Also when in exile deck yourselves with <i>mitsvoth</i>, in order that on your return to your own land the Divine precepts should not seem
to you new and unknown.” This passage has been misinterpreted as if the author of
that passage were of opinion that precepts like <i>tsitsith</i> and <i>tefillin</i> did originally not apply to those who are outside the Holy Land. The meaning is rather
this: Although a large portion of the laws is not in force outside Palestine, yet
continue to wear these reminders in exile, in order that by this act your attention
may constantly be turned to the whole Torah, to those precepts which are in force
at present as well as to those which are not. Thus all the precepts will be familiar
to you, and when the time comes in which the observance of all the laws will again
be possible, none of the laws will appear to you new and strange.
</p>
<p class="small">4. There is, on the whole, no difference between men and women with regard to the
obedience due to the Divine commandments. All Jews are equally bound to obey the Will
of God expressed in the Law. This is absolutely the case with all prohibitions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא תעשה‎</span>). In the case of positive commandments (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות עשה‎</span><span class="corr" id="xd32e8957" title="Not in source">)</span> the following rule has been laid down by our Sages: Women are exempt from the performance
of such religious duties as are restricted to a certain period of time (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות‎</span>). The object of the seeming anomaly is probably this: the principal duty and the
privilege of women is to manage the household, a task that demands constant attention.
Religious acts which are to be performed at a certain time might involve an interference
with such of their household duties as demand immediate attention; <i>e.g.</i>, nursing a patient, a task which generally falls to the lot of the female section
of the family. Jewish women, nevertheless, zealously fulfil most of the duties from
which the above rule exempts them. They thus are most eager to obey the laws concerning
<i>shofar</i> on New-year, <i>lulab</i> on Tabernacles, and the like; and some of them are named as having conscientiously
laid <i>tefillin</i> (Mechilta on Exod. xiii. 9).

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The daily work which has chiefly the well-being of the body as its aim must be interrupted
on certain days which the Almighty has appointed for the promotion of man’s spiritual
well-being. Sabbath and Festivals are the days thus appointed, and are therefore called
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מועדי יי‎</span> “the seasons of the Lord,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מקראי קדש‎</span> “holy convocations.” The blessing derived from the observance of Holy-days in the
true spirit is described by the prophet as follows: “If thou keep back thy foot because
of the sabbath, from doing thy business on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight,
the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour it, not doing thine own ways, nor
finding thine own business, nor speaking thine own words: then thou shalt delight
thyself in the Lord: and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,
and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob, thy father” (Isa. lviii. 13, 14). To those
who fail to observe the seasons of the Lord in the true spirit, the prophet says in
the name of the Almighty: “Your new-moons and your festivals my soul hateth: they
are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them” (<i>ibid.</i> i. 14).
</p>
<p>Maimonides<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8992src" href="#xd32e8992">27</a> comprehends the various duties and observances of the Holy-days in the following
four terms: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכור‎</span> “remember,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמור‎</span> “take heed,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כבוד‎</span> “honour,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עונג‎</span> “delight.” The first two are found in the Pentateuch, and form the beginning of the
fourth commandment in Exodus and Deuteronomy respectively; the other two occur in
the above description <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>of the Sabbath quoted from Isaiah (lviii. 13, 14). Following the example of our great
teacher, we shall likewise treat of the laws and customs of Sabbath and Festivals
under these four heads:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9012src" href="#xd32e9012">28</a>—
</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.4.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum"><i>a.</i></span> <span class="corr" id="xd32e9020" title="Source: ‏כר‎"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכור‎</span></span> “<i>Remember.</i>”</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Remember the Sabbath-day; speak of it, of its holiness and its blessings. We fulfil
this duty when Sabbath comes in, by the <i>Kiddush</i>, “the sanctification of the day,” in which we praise the Almighty for the boon bestowed
upon us by the institution of the Sabbath; and when Sabbath goes out, by the <i>Habhdalah</i>, in which we praise God for the “distinction” made between the holy and the ordinary
days. We have both <i>Kiddush</i> and <i>Habhdalah</i> in a double form: (<i>a</i>) as a portion of the <i>Amidah</i> in the Evening Service; the <i>Kiddush</i> being the middle section of the <i>Amidah</i>, the <i>Habhdalah</i> consisting of a prayer added to the fourth paragraph beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אתה חנן‎</span>; (<i>b</i>) as a separate service especially intended for our homes. It is this home-service
that we generally understand by the terms <i>Kiddush</i> and <i>Habhdalah</i>, and in this sense they are employed in the following.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9061src" href="#xd32e9061">29</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.1.1"><i>Kiddush.</i>
</p>
<p>There is a traditional explanation of the term <i>zachor</i>: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכרהו על היין‎</span> “remember it over the wine.” As “wine <span class="pageNum" id="pb341a">[<a href="#pb341a">341</a>]</span>gladdens the heart of man” and forms an important element in a festive meal, it has
been ordered that our meal on the eve<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9094src" href="#xd32e9094">30</a> of Sabbath and Festival should be begun with a cup of wine in honour of the day,
and that mention should be made of the holiness of the day before partaking of the
wine. The <i>Kiddush</i> consists of two blessings (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות‎</span>): one over the wine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9113src" href="#xd32e9113">31</a> and one that refers to the holiness of the day. On Holy-days—except the last days
of Passover—a third blessing (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהחינו‎</span>) follows, praising God for having granted us life and enabled us again to celebrate
the Festival. On Friday evening a portion from Genesis (i. 31 to ii. 3) is added,
which contains the first mention of the institution of Sabbath. If a Festival happens
to fall on Sunday, we add part of the <i>Habhdalah</i> to the <i>Kiddush</i> on Saturday evening,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9130src" href="#xd32e9130">32</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb342a">[<a href="#pb342a">342</a>]</span>referring to the distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the Festivals.
</p>
<p>The <i>Kiddush</i> is part of the Sabbath or Festival evening meal, and in the absence of the latter
the <i>Kiddush</i> is omitted.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9165src" href="#xd32e9165">33</a> In Synagogues of the German and Polish <i>Minhag</i> the Reader recites the <i>Kiddush</i> at the conclusion of the <i>Maarib</i> Service. This custom is a survival of the ancient way of providing for the poor and
the stranger. In the absence of better accommodation lodging and food were given to
the needy in rooms adjoining the Synagogue, or even in the Synagogue itself. It was
for these that the Reader recited the <i>Kiddush</i>, before they commenced the evening meal, as most probably wine was not served to
all. Although circumstances have changed the mode of maintaining the poor, and the
latter find no longer lodging and board in the Synagogue, the <i>Kiddush</i> has been retained as part of the <i>Maarib</i> Service, except on the first two nights of Passover, when there had never been an
occasion for reading <i>Kiddush</i> in the Synagogue. The poor were treated on these nights with four cups of wine each,
and they recited <i>Kiddush</i> by themselves as part of the <i>Seder</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.4.1.2"><i>Habhdalah</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הבדלה‎</span>.
</p>
<p><i>Habhdalah</i> is recited in the evening following Sabbath or Holy-day, after the Evening Service.
A cup of wine is raised, and the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכה‎</span> over wine is followed by another <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכה‎</span>, in which God is praised for the distinction made between the holy and the ordinary
day (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בין קדש לחול‎</span>), or between two kinds of holiness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בין קדש לקדש‎</span>) in case Sabbath is followed by a Holy-day.—On Sabbath night we take a candle and
a spice-box, and add two blessings after that over wine; in the one we thank God for
the enjoyment of the fragrance, in the other for the benefit He bestowed on us by
the creation of light. A few verses from the Bible, especially the Prophets, precede
the <i>Habhdalah</i>.
</p>
<p>The origin of the introduction of the blessings for light and for spices in the <i>Habhdalah</i> may be the following:—The principal meal of the day used to be taken about sunset;
light and burning incense were essential elements of a festive meal. On Sabbath these
could not be had, and were therefore enjoyed immediately after the going out of Sabbath.
Although the custom of having incense after the meal has long ceased, it has survived
in the <i>Habhdalah</i>, and has, in course of time, received another, a more poetical interpretation. The
Sabbath inspires us with cheerfulness, gives us, as it were, an additional soul—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נְשָׁמָה יְתֵרָה‎</span>—traces of which are left on the departure of Sabbath, and are symbolised by the fragrance
of the spices. For the use of the special light there has likewise been suggested
a second reason, namely, that it is intended at the commencement <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>of the week to remind us of the first product of Creation, which was light.
</p>
<p>There are a few customs connected with the <i>Habhdalah</i> that may be noticed here.
</p>
<p>(1.) The wine, when poured into the cup, is allowed to flow over, as a symbol of the
overflowing Divine blessing which we wish and hope to enjoy in the coming week.
</p>
<p>(2.) Some dip their finger in wine and pass it over their eyes, in allusion to the
words of the Nineteenth Psalm (ver. 9), “The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening
the eyes.” The act expresses the love of the Divine commandments (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חִבּוּב מִצְוָה‎</span>).
</p>
<p>(3.) Only male persons partake of the wine; they have more interest in the <i>Habhdalah</i> as the signal for the resumption of ordinary work and business.—The exclusion of
women from the wine of <i>Habhdalah</i> may also have its origin in the fact that Jewish women generally abstained from taking
wine, considering strong drink suitable only for the male portion of mankind. They
only partake of the wine of <i>Kiddush</i> on account of its importance; to <i>Habhdalah</i> less importance was ascribed.
</p>
<p>(4.) On reaching the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בין אור לחשך‎</span>, “between light and darkness,” some hold their hands against the light, the fingers
bent inside, in illustration of the words which they utter, showing darkness and shadow
inside and light outside.—With the practice of these and similar customs we must take
good care that we should not combine any superstitious motive, or join actions which
are really superstitious, and did not originate in Jewish thought and Jewish traditions.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>We further remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it by increased devotion, by reading
special Lessons from the Pentateuch and the Prophets, and by attending religious instruction
given by teachers and preachers.
</p>
<p>Besides various additions in the Service, and the substitution of one paragraph concerning
Sabbath or Festival for the thirteen middle paragraphs of the Amidah, there is another
Service inserted between the Morning and the Afternoon Services; it is called <i>Musaph</i>, “the Additional Service,” and corresponds to the additional offering ordained for
Sabbath and Festival (Num. xxviii. 9, <i>sqq.</i>).
</p>
<p>An essential element in the Morning Service is the Reading from the Torah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קריאת התורה‎</span>) and the Prophets (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הפטרה‎</span>). A periodical public reading from the Law was enjoined in the following words: “At
the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
of tabernacles, when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place
which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Gather the people together, men and women and children, and the stranger that is within
thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God,
and observe to do all the words of this law; and that their children, which have not
known anything, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God” (Deut. xxxi. 10–13).
</p>
<p>A seven years’ interval would surely have destroyed the impression produced by the
reading. The reading was probably repeated throughout the country at shorter intervals.
Tradition ascribes to Moses the institution of reading the Law every Sabbath, Monday,
and Thursday morning, in order that three days might never pass <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>without Torah. Ezra is said to have added the reading on Sabbath afternoon, and to
have made various other regulations with regard to the reading of the Law.
</p>
<p>Quantity and manner of reading were at first, no doubt, variable. In the course of
time certain systems found favour and became the fixed rule. Some completed the reading
of the whole Pentateuch in three years, others in one year. The former mode was gradually
displaced by the latter, and the attempts which have lately been made to revive it
have not succeeded. Traces of the triennial reading may be noticed in the number of
<i>sedarim</i> contained <span class="corr" id="xd32e9280" title="Corrected by author from: in each of the">in the</span> five books of the Pentateuch. At present, however, the annual course is followed
in almost all our Synagogues. The section read on one Sabbath is called <i>sidra</i>; the first, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span>, is read the first Sabbath after the Feast of Tabernacles, and the last <i>sidra</i> is read on <i>Simchath-torah</i> (the 23rd of Tishri).
</p>
<p>For the Festivals such sections were selected as contained either direct or indirect
reference to the Festivals. If these happen to be on a Sabbath, the ordinary reading
is interrupted, and that of the Festivals substituted for it.
</p>
<p>The number of persons who were to take part in the reading varied according as the
people were likely to devote less or more time to Divine Service: on weekdays and
on Sabbath afternoon three, on New-moon and <i>Chol-hammoed</i> four, on the Festivals five, on the Day of Atonement six,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9298src" href="#xd32e9298">34</a> and on Sabbath seven. Some may have required the assistance of the <i>chazan</i>, and in <span class="pageNum" id="pb347a">[<a href="#pb347a">347</a>]</span>some cases the <i>chazan’s</i> voice was the only one that was heard; gradually the <i>chazan</i> became the reader, and the original reader became silent, being content with reciting
the <i>b’rachoth</i>. Only in the case of the <i>Bar-mitsvah</i>, the <i>Chathan-torah</i>, and the <i>Chathan-b’reshith</i> the original practice has been retained.
</p>
<p>As regards the order of those who take part in the reading of the Law, the first place
is given to a <i>Cohen</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a descendant of Aaron, the priest; the second to a Levite, <i>i.e.</i>, a non-priest of the tribe of Levi; and then follow other Israelites, that are neither
Levites nor <i>Cohanim</i>, without any prescribed order. The last who concludes the reading from the Law on
those days on which a chapter from the Prophets is also read is called <i>maftir</i>, “concluding;” and the lesson from the Prophets is called <i>haphtarah</i>, “conclusion.”
</p>
<p>In the selection of the <i>haphtarah</i> care was taken that it should contain some reference to the contents of the lesson
from the Pentateuch, and as there was not much choice, the <i>haphtarah</i>, once chosen, was as a rule read again on the recurrence of the same <i>sidra</i>. Different communities had different series of <i>haphtaroth</i>. A few negative rules concerning the selection of the <i>haphtarah</i> are mentioned in the Mishnah (Megillah iv. 10); Ezek. i. and xvi., 2 Sam. xi. and
xiii., are to be excluded. These rules, however, were not observed, as Ezek. i. is
the <i>haphtarah</i> for the first day of the Feast of Weeks. There is an ancient rule about the nature
of the <i>haphtaroth</i> between the Fast of Tamuz and New-year; viz., there should be three <i>haphtaroth</i> of “rebuke” <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>and seven of “comfort” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נ׳ דפרענותא‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ז׳ דנחמתא‎</span>). The former are taken from Jeremiah (i. and ii.) and Isaiah (i.); the latter are
selected from Isaiah (xl. to<span id="xd32e9365"></span> lxvi.)
</p>
<p>Various accounts are given of the origin of the <i>haphtarah</i>. One account traces its origin to a period of persecution, when the Jews were not
allowed to read from the Torah, and the scrolls of the Law were either confiscated
or concealed. In both cases it was easy to read from the Prophets, for this could
be done by heart and in any place; whilst for the reading of the Torah it was necessary
to produce a copy of the Law. According to another account, the <i>haphtarah</i> served as a protest against the theory of the Samaritans, who recognised the Torah
alone as holy. But it is more likely and more natural to suppose that the <i>haphtarah</i> was introduced as soon as the Prophets became part of the Holy Scriptures.
</p>
<p>There was a tendency to have recourse to the Divine messages of future comfort and
glory when the present was gloomy and sad. At the end of the Service or a religious
discourse, just before leaving the Synagogue or the <i>Beth ha-midrash</i>, passages from the Prophets were read, in order that the people might carry away
with them a strengthened faith in God and in the ultimate victory of their religion.
On Sabbath morning the lessons from the Prophets were of greater importance, since
a larger number congregated, and more time could be devoted to it. A <i>b’rachah</i> therefore introduced it, and <i>b’rachoth</i>, including a prayer for the restoration of Zion, followed it. The name <i>haphtarah</i> suggests this explanation; it denotes literally “causing to leave,” “departure,”
or “conclusion.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the return of the Jews from Babylon they spoke the Chaldee dialect; the lessons
from the Bible were accordingly accompanied by a Chaldee translation called <i>targum</i>. The translation was not always literal, but was frequently a paraphrase. It was
given, as a rule, after each verse, by an appointed <i>methurgeman</i>.—In communities which only understood Greek the Greek version was read. A Spanish
translation of the <i>haphtarah</i> is still added at present on the Fast of <i>Ab</i> in the Portuguese Ritual; but otherwise the practice of adding a translation to the
text has long since been discontinued.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.4.2.1" class="first">The negative commandment concerning the Holy-days is: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא תעשה כל מלאכה‎</span>, “Thou shalt do no manner of work.” The very name Sabbath (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת‎</span>, “rest”) implies absence of labour. We are commanded to rest on the Sabbath, but
not to indulge in laziness and indolence, which are by no means conducive to the health
of the body or the soul. The Sabbath rest is described in our Sabbath Afternoon Service
as “voluntary and congenial, true and faithful, and happy and cheerful.” Moderate
exercise, cheerful reading, and pleasant conversation are indispensable for a rest
of this kind.
</p>
<p>What is to be understood by the term “labour” or “work” in the prohibition “Thou shalt
not do any manner of work”? The Pentateuch gives no definition of the term. But the
Israelites, when they were told that work was prohibited on Sabbath, and that <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>any breach of the law was to be punished with death, must have received <i>orally</i> a full explanation of the prohibition. A case is mentioned of one who profaned the
Sabbath by gathering sticks, and was put to death; this could not have been done if
any doubt had been left in his mind whether the act of gathering sticks was included
in the prohibition.
</p>
<p>A few instances of work prohibited on a Sabbath-day are met with in the Bible. In
connection with the manna, the prohibition of cooking and baking is mentioned; also
the commandment, “Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day” (Exod. xvi. 29);
<i>i.e.</i>, we must not travel or go beyond a certain distance<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9425src" href="#xd32e9425">35</a> on the Sabbath. Another act distinctly forbidden is contained in the words, “Ye shall
kindle no fire in all your dwellings on the day of rest” (<i>ibid.</i> xxxv. 3). The prophet Amos (viii. 5), in rebuking the Israelites for cheating their
fellow-men, puts the following words into their mouth: “When will the new moon be
gone, that we may sell corn? and the Sabbath, that we may open our stores of wheat?”
This shows that the Israelites conducted no business on New-moon and Sabbath. Jeremiah
(xvii. 21 <i>sqq.</i>) says as follows: “Thus saith the Lord, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden
on the sabbath day, nor bring it in <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>by the gates of Jerusalem; neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the
sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day.”—Nehemiah relates
(xiii. 15): “In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the sabbath,
and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all
manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. Then I said unto them, What evil
thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day?” As a general rule, we may say
that the work prohibited on Sabbath and Festivals embraces two classes: viz., (1)
All such acts as are legally—<i>i.e.</i>, in the Oral Law—defined as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכה‎</span> “work.” It makes no difference whether we consider any of them as labour or not.
Under thirty-nine different heads<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9449src" href="#xd32e9449">36</a> they are enumerated in the Mishnah (Shabbath vii. 2). The following are a few of
them:—Ploughing, sowing, reaping, threshing, <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>grinding, baking, hunting, killing an animal, tanning, sewing, writing, kindling light
or fire, and carrying things abroad.
</p>
<p>(2.) Everything which our conscience tells us to be inappropriate for the Sabbath;
acts which come neither under the head of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכה‎</span> nor under that of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבות‎</span>, but which would tend to change the Sabbath into an ordinary day; <i>e.g.</i>, preparing for our daily business transactions, although such preparation does not
involve an actual breach of any of the Sabbath laws.
</p>
<p>Whatever we are not allowed to do ourselves, we must not have done for us by a co-religionist,
who deliberately disregards the fourth commandment. Neither must we employ non-Israelites
to do our work on Sabbath, except in case of need; <i>e.g.</i>, in case of illness or fear of illness.
</p>
<p>As regards Holy-days, there is the general rule that work (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכה‎</span>) prohibited on Sabbath must not be done on Holy-days: “Save that which every man
must eat, that only may be done of you” (Exod. xii. 16); that is to say, it is allowed
on Festivals to cook, to bake, or to prepare food in any other way.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9495src" href="#xd32e9495">37</a> Of course, for the Festival that happens to fall on a Sabbath, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb353a">[<a href="#pb353a">353</a>]</span>laws of Sabbath remain in force. The Day of Atonement is in this respect equal to
Sabbath.
</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.4.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum"><i>c.</i></span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענג‎</span> “<i>Delight.</i>”</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.4.3.1" class="first">The principal and noblest delight yielded by Holy-days is the pleasure we feel in
more frequent communion with the Divine Being, in the purer and holier thoughts with
which we are inspired when at rest from ordinary work, and able to devote ourselves
more fully <span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>to the contemplation of the works and words of God. In this sense the day of rest
is described in one of the hymns (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמירות‎</span>) after supper as “a foretaste of the world to come” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעין עולם הבא יום שבת מנוחה‎</span>).
</p>
<p>But <i>oneg shabbath</i> includes also delight of a less spiritual character. We are not commanded on the
days of rest to forget altogether the wants of the body. On the contrary. Nehemiah,
when on the first day of the seventh month, that is, on New-year, he perceived that
his brethren were sad, addressed them thus: “Go your way, eat the fat and drink the
sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy
unto the Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of the Lord is your strength” (Neh.
viii. 10). The same conception of “the sabbath unto the Lord” is met with in Talmud,
Midrash, and throughout the whole of the Rabbinical literature. In one of our Sabbath-hymns
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמירות‎</span>) we say: “This day is for Israel, light and joy, a sabbath of rest;” and in our prayers
for Sabbath we glory in being <i>shom’re shabbath ve-kor’e oneg</i>, “observers of the sabbath, and such as call it a delight.”—With regard to the Festivals,
the duty of rejoicing is repeatedly enjoined (Deut. xvi. 11, 14).
</p>
<p>In our regulations, customs, and prayers for Sabbath and Festivals, this duty is clearly
indicated. All fasting and mourning is prohibited. Care was taken that Divine Service
should be free from such prayers as would be likely to create feelings of grief and
sadness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9596src" href="#xd32e9596">38</a> A special formula has also been introduced for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>expression of our sympathy with the sick and the mourner on Sabbath and Festivals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9604src" href="#xd32e9604">39</a>
</p>
<p>When any of the obligatory fasts—except the Day of Atonement—happens to fall on a
Sabbath, the fasting is put off (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נדחה‎</span>) till the next day, or kept, as in the case of the fast of Esther, on the preceding
Thursday. Tradition has raised the taking of the three regular meals on Sabbath (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש סעודות‎</span>), viz., supper, breakfast, and dinner, to a religious act—a <i>mitsvah</i>, and the religious character of the meals is shown by the special prayers and hymns—<i>zemiroth</i>—which accompany them. A fourth meal is, according to some authority, likewise obligatory;
whilst, according to another authority, it may be replaced by spiritual food, by reading
and studying the Torah.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.4.4.1" class="first">We honour the day inwardly by considering it a holy, distinguished season, which ought
to be devoted to higher objects than the wants of our body. Our mind should be entirely
turned aside from our daily business, in order to be free for loftier and holier thoughts.
For the purpose of effecting this inward distinction of the Sabbath, we honour it
also outwardly by various things, which are partly a symbol, partly a reminder of
the distinction claimed by the day. We honour the Sabbath, therefore, by giving a
festive appearance to our meals, our dress, and our dwelling. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>principal thing required is neatness and cheerfulness; not luxury. On the contrary,
we are guided in this respect by the principle: Make rather thy Sabbath an ordinary
day—<i>i.e.</i>, omit the distinction in food and dress—than render thyself dependent on the support
of thy fellow-men.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9639src" href="#xd32e9639">40</a>
</p>
<p>It is customary to have two loaves on the table, over which the blessing <i>ha-motsee</i> is said. They are to remind us of the double portion of bread or manna (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לחם משנה‎</span>, Exod. xvi. 22) given to the Israelites in the wilderness on the sixth day because
of the succeeding Sabbath-day. The cloth spread beneath the loaves, and the cover
over them, represent symbolically the dew which both lay on the ground under the manna
and also over it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9653src" href="#xd32e9653">41</a> The origin of this custom of covering the bread may perhaps be found in the following
Talmudic law: “If a meal that has commenced on Friday afternoon is continued in the
night, it must be interrupted when Sabbath comes in; a cloth is to be spread over
the bread whilst the <i>Kiddush</i> is recited” (Babyl. Talm. Pesachim, 100<i>a</i>). The spreading of the cloth appears to be here merely a sign of the pause, and the
distinction between the ordinary meal and that of Sabbath.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9661src" href="#xd32e9661">42</a> That which was at first ordained for <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>special cases became in course of time a general custom.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9673src" href="#xd32e9673">43</a>
</p>
<p>The loaves are called <i>birchoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות‎</span>), <i>taashir</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תעשיר‎</span>), or <i>challah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלה‎</span>). The first name they received as symbols of God’s blessing, the double portion of
manna which the Almighty sent to the Israelites on Friday because of the Sabbath (see
Rashi on Gen. ii. 3). The verse, “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תעשיר‎</span>, Prov. x. 22), suggested the second name. <i>Challah</i> reminds us of the commandment to give the first part of the dough to the priest (Num.
xv. 17–21). Although at present this commandment cannot be carried out, we separate
a small piece, called <i>challah</i>, of the dough which we prepare for bread, and burn it, after having recited an appropriate
blessing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9705src" href="#xd32e9705">44</a> It is customary to prepare the dough for the Sabbath loaves at home, in order to
be able to act in accordance with this custom. This is one of the religious acts which
it is the special duty of women to perform, and some of the pious women of Israel
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשים צדקניות‎</span>) have the praiseworthy custom to lay something aside for charity when performing
this or similar religious acts.
</p>
<p>Another act performed in honour of Sabbath and <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>Festivals is the kindling of special lights before the holy day comes in, to indicate
symbolically the approach of a day of light and cheerfulness. This duty is likewise
the privilege of the housewife<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9719src" href="#xd32e9719">45</a> or her representative. Before<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9722src" href="#xd32e9722">46</a> kindling the lights the following blessing is recited: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך אתה … וצונו להדליק נר של שבת‎</span> “Blessed art thou … and hast commanded us to kindle the sabbath lights.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום טוב‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הכפורים‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת ויום טוב‎</span>, or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת ויום הכפורים‎</span> is substituted for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת‎</span> according as a Holy-day, the Day of Atonement, or these days when they happen to
fall on a Saturday, come in. On Festivals, except the last days of Passover, the following
blessing, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהחינו‎</span>, is added: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … שהחינו וקימנו והגיענו לזמן הזה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast kept us in life, preserved us, and enabled us to reach
this season.”

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Notes.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">1. The reading of the Law is preceded and followed by a blessing. In the first we
praise God for having distinguished Israel by revealing the Law to them, and in the
second for the benefit derived from the Law as the source of eternal life. The love
and regard for the Law expressed in these blessings should be shown by the congregants
in silent and respectful attention to what is recited by the Reader. Those who are
called up to the Law consider this as an important event, and make it an occasion
of special prayers for relatives and friends (<i>mi-shebberach</i>), accompanied <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>by promises of contributions to communal and charitable institutions. On days of family
rejoicing, as well as on days of mourning, the religious privilege of being called
to the Reading of the Law is especially valued; in the former case offerings are vowed
in honour of our living friends, in the other case <i>in memoriam</i> of those near and dear to us, who have departed from our midst. These additional
prayers thus serve a double purpose; they help to preserve the bond of relationship
and friendship, and secure a material support for the benevolent and other institutions
of the community.
</p>
<p class="small">Objections have been raised to this in itself praiseworthy custom for two reasons:
first, the <i>mi-shebberach</i> only concerns a few, and appears to the rest of the congregation a useless interruption
in the reading of the Law; secondly, it gives occasion to a display of vanity and
pride.
</p>
<p class="small">As to the first objection, provision could and should be made that the interruption
be not unduly long, and cause irritation among the congregants. Due regard should
be shown to the fact that the Divine Book is open on the reading-desk, and everything
should be avoided that might diminish the reverence proper to such an occasion. The
second objection is based on a pessimistic estimate of our fellow-men; if there is
any one whose offerings are made from vain and ostentatious motives, he is certainly
lost in the multitude of those who take a more serious and a more dignified view of
their duties when standing before the open Torah.
</p>
<p class="small">2. There is an old tradition that we should recite daily a hundred benedictions. On
Sabbath and Holy-days, when the Amidah contains only seven <i>berachoth</i> instead of eighteen, the deficiency is made up by seeking an occasion for <i>birchoth ha-nehenin</i>. Hence the <i>minhag</i> spread of partaking on these days of various kinds of fruit between the meals.
</p>
<p class="small">3. Tradition teaches us that on the holy days of rest we must not only abstain from
actual work, but also from ordering anything to be done by those who refuse to recognise
the Sabbath-laws as binding on them.—Circumstances force us to deviate at times from
this rule. There were Jews who would not allow any work to be undertaken on Friday
which would continue of its own accord after the Sabbath had set in. Thus they would
not have light in their homes on Friday evening or warm food <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>on the Sabbath-day, although all necessary precautions had been taken before Sabbath
came in to keep the light burning and the food warm for twenty-four hours. But the
more these Jews insisted on excluding light and fire from their homes, the more did
our Sages demand light and warm food as essential comforts of the Sabbath, and to
them the Sabbath-candles and the warm food were a <i>mitsvah</i> of great importance. Much work is done on Sabbath for the public by non-Jews; <i>e.g.</i>, in connection with railway-trains, steamboats, and other public conveyances. May
the Jew avail himself of the work thus done for all alike without his bidding? He
may in some cases—<i>e.g.</i>, for a long sea-voyage—in others not. But he must always bear in mind that Judaism
depends on the adherence of the Jews to the noble principle, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל ישראל ערבים זה בזה‎</span> “All Israelites are sureties responsible for each other.” The meaning of this principle
is this: If a certain act appears to one of us allowable, but at the same time our
action might mislead others and cause them to break the Law, we must not do it. Thus
if Jews were to avail themselves of the public conveyances, the whole aspect of the
Sabbath would change, and the day would ultimately be forgotten.
</p>
<p class="small">4. When dire necessity compels a Jew to break the Sabbath, let him not think that
the Sabbath is lost to him, or he to Judaism. So long as Jewish conscientiousness
is alive within him, let him endeavour to keep as much of the Sabbath as he is able.
He must not say, “I have broken the Sabbath. How can I join my brethren in the Sabbath
Service!” Whatever he does conscientiously will be acceptable before God, and he will
thus find himself exhorted to watch carefully, and to seize the first opportunity
of returning to the full observance of Sabbath. The same principle applies to all
the Divine Precepts.

<p class="first">The Jewish Calendar<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9799src" href="#xd32e9799">47</a> reckons the day from evening to evening, in accordance with the order observed in
<span class="pageNum" id="pb361a">[<a href="#pb361a">361</a>]</span>the verse, “And it was evening and it was morning, one day” (Gen. i. 5). The evening
begins after sunset, at the moment when stars become visible under normal conditions
of the atmosphere: at <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צאת הכוכבים‎</span> “the coming forth of the stars,” <i>scil.</i>, of at least three stars of middle size.
</p>
<p>The day is divided into evening, morning, and afternoon. With each of these periods
is connected an appropriate prayer or service, viz., <i>Maarib</i> or Evening-prayer, <i>Shacharith</i> or Morning-prayer, and <i>Minchah</i> or Afternoon-prayer.
</p>
<p>Seven days form a week. The days of the week are described in the Bible and the Talmud
simply as the first day, the second day, &amp;c. Only the seventh day has a second name,
<i>Yom ha-shabbath</i> or <i>shabbath</i>, “the day of rest,” or “the rest.” In post-Biblical literature the sixth day is called
<i>Erebh shabbath</i> or <i>Ma’ale shabbatha</i>, “the eve of Sabbath,” or “the coming in of Sabbath.” The evening following Sabbath
is named <i>Motseë shabbath</i>, “the departure of Sabbath.” Similarly the day preceding a Festival and the evening
following it are called <i>Erev yom-tobh</i> and <i>Motseë yom-tobh</i>, “the eve of the Festival.” and “the departure of the Festival.”
</p>
<p>Four weeks and one or two days make one month, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חדש‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ירח‎</span>. The length of the month is determined by the duration of one revolution of the moon
round the earth. Such revolution is completed in twenty-nine days and a half.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9857src" href="#xd32e9857">48</a> As, however, the calendar mouth <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>does not commence in the middle of the day, but at the beginning of the evening, it
was necessary to add half a day to one month, and to take off half a day from the
next. The months have therefore alternately twenty-nine and thirty days.
</p>
<p>The months are named according to their order, the first month, the second, &amp;c.; the
first being the first month in the spring. Other names, implying agricultural and
climatic relations, were likewise in use, and the following four of them have been
preserved in the Bible: the first month is called <i>Abib</i>, “ears of corn;” the second <i>Ziv</i>, “beauty;” the seventh <i>Ethanim</i>, “hardy fruit;” and the eighth, <i>Bul</i>, “rain.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9875src" href="#xd32e9875">49</a> Since the return of the Jews from the Babylonian exile, names of foreign origin have
been in use, viz., <i>Nisan</i>, <i>Iyar</i>, <i>Sivan</i>, <i>Tammuz</i>, <i>Abh</i>, <i>Elul</i>, <i>Tishri</i>, <i>Cheshvan</i>, <i>Kislev</i>, <i>Tebheth</i>, <i>Shebhat</i> and <i>Adar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9905src" href="#xd32e9905">50</a> Roughly speaking, these months correspond to April, May, June, July, August, September,
October, November, December, January, February, and March.
</p>
<p>The year is either an ordinary year or a leap-year, the former consisting of twelve,
the latter of thirteen months. The extra month is called <i>Adar-sheni</i>, “the second <i>Adar</i>,” and is added between <i>Adar</i> and <i>Nisan</i>. It serves to adjust from time to time the lunar to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>solar year;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9925src" href="#xd32e9925">51</a> for there is between the lunar year—that is, the time of twelve revolutions of the
moon round the earth—and the solar year, or the time of one revolution of the earth
round the sun, a difference of about eleven days, the one consisting of about 354⅓,
the other of about 365¼ days. In nineteen years the difference amounts to about seven
months. We have therefore seven leap-years in every cycle (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מחזור‎</span>) of nineteen years, viz., the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th.
</p>
<p>Neither the ordinary years nor the leap-years have a uniform duration; the former
fluctuate between 353, 354, and 355 days; the latter between 383, 384, and 385 days.
The following is the cause of this variety: There are certain days in the week which
are never made the beginning of the new year (the 1st of <i>Tishri</i>). Whenever the astronomical beginning of the year happens to be on one of these days,
a day is added to one year, and taken from the next. The addition in the former case
is made in the month of <i>Cheshvan</i>, and the curtailing in the latter case in the month of <i>Kislev</i>. The length of the months is therefore as follows:—<i>Nisan</i>, 30; <i>Iyar</i>, 29; <i>Sivan</i>, 30; <i>Tammuz</i>, 29; <i>Abh</i>, 30; <i>Elul</i>, 29; <i>Tishri</i>, 30; <i>Cheshvan</i>, 29 or 30; <i>Kislev</i>, 30 or 29; <i>Tebheth</i>, 29; <i>Shebhat</i>, 30; <i>Adar</i>, 29, in leap-year 30; <i>Adar-sheni</i> (in leap-year), 29 days.
</p>
<p>The first day of the month is called New-moon-day <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חדש‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9974src" href="#xd32e9974">52</a> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ראש חדש‎</span>, “beginning of the month.” In those months which have thirty days, the thirtieth
day is likewise kept as <i>Rosh-chodesh</i>.
</p>
<p>The beginning of the astronomical month is the moment of the conjunction of sun and
moon,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9990src" href="#xd32e9990">53</a> when the moon is exactly between the earth and the sun. Nothing is then visible of
the moon. Six hours at least later a very small portion of the moon can, under favourable
conditions, be seen, and the day on which this takes place is the first of the calendar
month.
</p>
<p>At first, from the earliest days down to Hillel II. (about 360 <span class="asc">C.E.</span>), <i>Rosh-chodesh</i> was determined by direct observation. The highest court, the great <i>Sanhedrin</i>, examined the witnesses who had noticed the reappearance of the moon, and accordingly
determined the first day of the month by the solemn declaration, <i>Mekuddash</i>, “sanctified;” that is, the day is to be kept as <i>Rosh-chodesh</i>. These proceedings took place on the thirtieth day of the month. If witnesses presented
themselves who testified to the appearance of the new moon, and after due examination
their statement was found to be correct, the same day was proclaimed as <i>Rosh-chodesh</i>, and the preceding month had twenty-nine days; if no witnesses presented themselves,
or the witnesses could not sustain their evidence, the day was added to the expiring
month, and the day following was the first of the next month. The decision of the
<i>Sanhedrin</i> concerned only the thirtieth day of the month. As soon as their decision was arrived
at, Jewish congregations located within a certain distance were informed by <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>signal or by trustworthy messengers which day had been fixed as the first of the new
month. The decrees of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the highest religious council of the nation, were accepted by all Jewish congregations
as law, and the Festivals were celebrated in accordance with the New Moon thus appointed.
There were, however, Jewish congregations in distant parts that could not be reached
by the messengers in due time, and these were in doubt concerning the day on which
a Festival had to be celebrated. Being anxious not to miss the day kept as a Festival
on the authority of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> by their brethren at the religious centre of the nation, the Jews abroad observed
two days as Holy-days instead of one; only the Fast of the Day of Atonement had no
additional day, because, being a fast-day, the majority of the people were unable
to abstain from food for two consecutive days. New-year, on the other hand, was, as
a rule, everywhere observed two days, even in places near the seat of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, and sometimes even in the very place where the <i>Sanhedrin</i> met, on account of the uncertainty whether the 30th of <i>Elul</i> or the day following would be fixed by the <i>Sanhedrin</i> as <i>Rosh ha-shanah</i>. Though, with regard to the most holy Festival, the uncertainty of the day admitted
of no remedy, this circumstance did not prevent our pious ancestors from applying
a remedy where it could be done.
</p>
<p>It was not ignorance that led Jews outside Palestine to observe two Holy-days instead
of one. A rough calculation of the time in which the various phenomena of the moon
are to be noticed is not difficult, and could be made by many Rabbis and laymen long
before Hillel II. framed the permanent Calendar. Nevertheless, <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>two days were kept, because it was impossible to calculate or anticipate all the accidental
circumstances that might cause the <i>Sanhedrin</i> to defer the fixing of <i>Rosh-chodesh</i> for the next day.
</p>
<p>Nor was it a decree of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, or of a Rabbinical assembly, that ordered the observance of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום טוב שני‎</span>, “a second day of the Festival.” This was done by the voluntary act of the nation,
and their resolution was confirmed by continued usage. It was the outcome of genuine
piety, of the earnest desire to be at one with the central authority of the nation.
The observance of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום טוב שני‎</span> is so old that no trace of its actual introduction can be discovered in the Talmud;
wherever mention is made of it, it is represented as an institution already in existence.
It may already have existed in the days of the prophets, and traces of the celebration
of a second day of <i>Rosh-chodesh</i> may be recognised in the first book of Samuel (i. xx. 27).
</p>
<p>This practice, which sprang from true fear and love of God, was spontaneously adopted
by all the Jews outside Palestine, continued by generation after generation for more
than two thousand years, and has, as a <i>minhag</i> of long standing, become law. It is not a precept commanded in the Written Law, or
decreed in the Oral Law; it is only a <i>minhag</i> “practice,” but a <i>minhag</i> that must be cherished and respected as a national institution. There may come a
time when the institution of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום טוב שני‎</span> will be abolished; this can, however, only be done by the national will, confirmed
by a <i>Sanhedrin</i> which will be recognised by the whole nation as the only religious authority. Until
then it is incumbent upon us to adhere firmly to the observance of the second days
of the Festivals.

<p class="small">1. Twenty-nine days 12​793⁄1080 hours elapse between one <i>molad</i> and the next.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10078src" href="#xd32e10078">54</a>

<p class="small">3. The 1st of <i>Tishri</i> is fixed on the day of the <i>molad</i> of <i>Tishri</i>. There are four exceptions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דחיות‎</span>):—

</p>
<p class="small">The first of these four exceptions is to prevent the Day of Atonement from falling
on Friday or Sunday, and <i>Hoshaana-rabba</i> from falling on Sabbath; the third exception is to guard against having an ordinary
year of more than 355, and the last from having a leap-year of less than 383 days.
</p>
<p class="small">4. The character of the year is described by three letters, the first of which indicates
the day of the week for the 1st of <i>Tishri</i>, the last the day of the week for the 1st of <i>Nisan</i>, the middle letter, according as it is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כ‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ח‎</span>, or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span> (=<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כסדר‎</span> “regular;” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסרה‎</span> “defective;” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלמה‎</span> “perfect”), indicates a regular year of 354 (in leap-year 384) days, a defective

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Festivals.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their
seasons” (Lev. xxiii. 4), are Passover, Feast of Weeks, Day of Memorial, Day of Atonement,
and Feast of Tabernacles. These are divided into two groups called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלוש רגלים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ימים נוראים‎</span>, “three festivals” and “solemn days.” In the Pentateuch the two groups are kept distinctly
asunder. Thus in Exod. xxiii. 14–17 and xxxiv. 18, and Deut. xvi., only the former
group is mentioned.
</p>
<p>The name <i>shalosh regalim</i> derives its origin from the following Biblical passage: “Three times thou shalt keep
a feast unto me in the year,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש רגלים תחג לי בשנה‎</span> (Exod. xxiii. 14). Although in a parallel passage the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רגלים‎</span> has been replaced by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פעמים‎</span> (<i>ibid.</i> ver. 17), of the same meaning, “times,” <i>shalosh regalim</i> has been preferred, because <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רגלים‎</span> reminds one also of “a journey on foot,” “a pilgrimage,” an important element in
the celebration of these three festivals, according to the Divine commandment, “Three
times every year shall thy males appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which
he shall choose, in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the
feast of tabernacles” (Deut. xvi. 16).
</p>
<p>The name <i>yamim noraim</i> for the remaining two feasts is not founded on a Biblical phrase, but on the fact
that these festivals are devoted more than the rest to earnest reflection and solemn
devotion.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">I.</span> <i>The Three Festivals</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש רגלים‎</span>).</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The three festivals have the following three characteristics in common:—
</p>
<p>1. They refer to important events in our national history; viz., Passover to the deliverance
of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage; Feast of Weeks to the Revelation on Mount
Sinai; and Tabernacles to the travels of the Israelites through the Arabian desert.
</p>
<p>2. They mark the various stages of the harvest; viz., Passover marks the season of
the early harvest, Feast of Weeks the second harvest, and the Feast of Tabernacles
the ingathering of the fruit.
</p>
<p>3. They serve as a means for imparting essential religious truths; viz., Passover
embodies the principle of the Existence of God, the Feast of Weeks that of Revelation,
and the Feast of Tabernacles that of Divine Providence.
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.6.1.1"><i>The Distinguished Sabbaths</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ד׳ פרשיות‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10275src" href="#xd32e10275">56</a>
</p>
<p>There are in the months <i>Adar</i> and <i>Nisan</i> four Sabbaths distinguished by the circumstance that on them additional sections
are read from the Pentateuch and special lessons from the Prophets. Two of them are
connected with the celebration of Passover.
</p>
<p>1. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת שקלים‎</span> “Sabbath of the shekels;” <i>i.e.</i>, on which the law concerning the half-shekel contribution is read from the Pentateuch
(Exod. xxx. 11–16), and also the account of the gifts for the repair of the Temple
in the reign of King Joash (2 Kings xii. <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>1–17). Every male Israelite, twenty years old or upward, had to contribute annually
one half-shekel towards the maintenance of the Temple and the Temple Service. The
year commenced the 1st of <i>Nisan</i>, when public sacrifices had to be bought with money of the new contributions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10295src" href="#xd32e10295">57</a> Every one was therefore expected to send his contribution before the 1st of <i>Nisan</i>. On the 1st of <i>Adar</i> proclamations were made throughout the country that the half-shekel was due.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10303src" href="#xd32e10303">58</a> Hence the custom to read the above-named sections on the Sabbath before the 1st of
<i>Adar</i>, or on the 1st, if this happens to be on a Sabbath.
</p>
<p>2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת זכור‎</span> “Sabbath Remember” is the Sabbath on which the paragraph concerning the enmity of
Amalek is read from the Pentateuch (Deut. xxv. 17–19), and the defeat of Amalek by
King Saul from the Prophets (I Sam. xv.). The Agagite Haman, one of the principal
figures in the history of <i>Purim</i>, is believed to be a descendant of Agag, king of Amalek (<i>ibid.</i> ver. 8). And as the Law commands us to remember the hostilities of Amalek against
Israel, it has been found appropriate to read the above sections on the Sabbath before
<i>Purim</i>.
</p>
<p>3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת פרה‎</span> “The Sabbath of the Red Heifer,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Sabbath on which the law concerning the sacrifice of the red heifer and the
purification with its ashes is read from the Pentateuch (Num. xix.), and “the future
purification of Israel” (Ezek. xxxvi. 17–38) from the Prophets. It is the Sabbath
after <i>Purim</i>, or, when the 15th or 16th of <i>Adar</i> falls on Saturday, the second Sabbath after <i>Purim</i>. All Israelites had <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>to come to the Temple, and to offer the Passover-lamb on the 14th of <i>Nisan</i>, and this could not be done by any unclean person. By the reading of the above sections,
all are, as it were, reminded to take the necessary steps for their purification,
and thus prepare themselves for the celebration of Passover.
</p>
<p>4. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת החדש‎</span> “The Sabbath of <i>ha-chodesh</i>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Sabbath before the 1st of <i>Nisan</i>, or on the 1st of <i>Nisan</i> if it falls on a Saturday, on which the law that fixes <i>Nisan</i> as the first month<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10353src" href="#xd32e10353">59</a> and the commandment concerning Passover are read from the Pentateuch (Exod. xii.
1–20), and the description of the sacrifices of the 1st of <i>Nisan</i>, Passover, and other Festivals in the future Temple from the Prophets (Ezek. xlv.
16–xlvi. 18).
</p>
<p>In addition to these four Sabbaths, the Sabbath preceding Passover is to be mentioned.
It is not distinguished by any special lesson from the Pentateuch, but it has nevertheless
received the title “the Great Sabbath,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת הגדול‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10372src" href="#xd32e10372">60</a> on account of the importance of <span class="pageNum" id="pb372a">[<a href="#pb372a">372</a>]</span>the approaching Festival. The last part of Malachi (iii. 4–24) is read as the <i>haphtarah</i> of the day, in which the ultimate triumph of the God-fearing is described by the
Prophet.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.4.6.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסח‎</span> <i>Passover.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Passover is the first of the Three Feasts, and is kept eight days, from the 15th of
<i>Nisan</i> to the 22nd; the four middle days being half-Holy-days, called <i>chol ha-moëd</i> (“the week-days of the festival”).
</p>
<p>The name <i>Pesach</i>, “Passover,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10408src" href="#xd32e10408">61</a> reminds us of the way in which the Israelites enjoyed the Divine protection before
they left Egypt. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, kept the Israelites as slaves, and when asked
in the name of God to let them go, refused to obey. But the ten plagues which consecutively
afflicted his land without causing injury to the Israelites taught <span class="pageNum" id="pb373a">[<a href="#pb373a">373</a>]</span>him the existence of a higher Power, to whose decrees the will of earthly rulers has
to submit. It was especially the tenth plague, the slaying of the first-born, that
convinced the king and his people of this truth. When the Lord smote all the first-born
in the land of Egypt, “he <i>passed over</i> the houses of the children of Israel” (Exod. xii. 27).
</p>
<p>The Feast has a second name, viz., “feast of unleavened bread,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חג המצות‎</span>, a name derived from the commandment to eat <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span> “unleavened bread,” instead of the ordinary <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חמץ‎</span> “leavened bread,” during the Festival. The purpose of this commandment is to commemorate
the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt as well as the mode of their actual departure.
For when the tenth plague, the slaying of the first-born, had visited the Egyptians,
they were overcome with fear, and urged the Israelites at once to leave the country.
The Israelites therefore left Egypt hurriedly, <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>and had no time for preparing the ordinary “leavened bread,” and baked for themselves
unleavened cakes (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצות‎</span>) of the dough which they had made.
</p>
<p>Passover thus commemorates two distinct moments in the deliverance of the Israelites
from Egyptian slavery, viz. (1) the special protection which the Almighty granted
them in Egypt, and (2) their departure from the house of bondage.
</p>
<p>Two distinct observances, therefore, were ordained for the Feast of Passover, viz.
(1) the sacrifice of the Passover-lamb, and (2) the eating of “unleavened bread” and
the abstaining from “leavened bread.”
</p>
<p>1. <i>The Passover-lamb.</i>—A short time before their departure from Egypt the Israelites were commanded by the
Almighty that on the tenth of the first month every family should procure a lamb,
keep it four days,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10474src" href="#xd32e10474">62</a> kill it in the afternoon of the fourteenth, sprinkle of its blood on the “lintel
and the two door-posts,” and “eat in the evening the meat roast in fire, with unleavened
bread and bitter herbs, in haste, their loins girded, their shoes on their feet and
their staff in their hand” (Exod. xii. 3–11). Whatever the material benefit was which
the Israelites, in the moment of starting for a long and uncertain journey, derived
from the meal prepared and partaken of in this manner, there was a higher purpose
in the Divine commandment; it was <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>demanded that the lamb should be “a passover sacrifice unto the Lord” (<i>ibid.</i>). The proceedings should be an expression of faith in God,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10484src" href="#xd32e10484">63</a> and of gratitude to Him for His protection. Every house should thus form a place
holy unto the Lord; an altar, as it were, on which the blood of the sacrifice was
sprinkled.
</p>
<p>The Passover sacrifice first observed in Egypt was afterwards ordained as a permanent
institution (<i>ibid.</i> ver. 24). This difference, however, was observed, that the Passover-lamb, like all
sacrifices, had to be brought to the Sanctuary, to “the place which the Lord chose
to place his name in” (Deut. xvi. 6). All who were prevented from performing their
duty on the 14th of <i>Nisan</i> were allowed to offer the Passover on the 14th of the second month (<i>Iyar</i>). By way of distinction from the sacrifice on the first date, this offering was called
“the second passover” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסח שני‎</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10500src" href="#xd32e10500">64</a> Num. ix. 9–14). Since the destruction of the Temple all sacrificial service has been
discontinued, and in accordance with the words, “We will compensate with our lips
for the bullocks” (Hos. xiv. 3), prayers and recitals from <span class="pageNum" id="pb376a">[<a href="#pb376a">376</a>]</span>the Bible have taken the place of sacrifices, whilst psalms and hymns are added such
as used to accompany the act of offering sacrifices. The Passover sacrifice has therefore
been discontinued; but the law of eating unleavened bread and bitter herbs is still
observed.
</p>
<p>2. <i>The Unleavened Bread.</i>—“Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall have put away
leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day
until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exod. xii. 15). “Unleavened
bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee,
neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters” (<i>ibid.</i> xiii. 7). “Seven days shall there no leaven be found in your houses” (<i>ibid.</i> xii. 19). The distinction between leavened and unleavened only applies to bread or
any other form of food prepared out of any of the following five kinds of grain: barley,
wheat, rye, oats, and spelt. Bread or cake prepared from any of these five kinds is
called unleavened bread, or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span>, if the dough is baked immediately after it has been prepared, no time being left
for fermentation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10521src" href="#xd32e10521">65</a> It is not only forbidden during the <span class="pageNum" id="pb377">[<a href="#pb377">377</a>]</span>Festival to eat leavened bread, but it is not permitted to derive any benefit whatsoever
from it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10533src" href="#xd32e10533">66</a> All leaven and leavened bread must be removed before Passover comes in; and in accordance
with the traditional interpretation of the precept, “Thou shalt not offer the blood
of my sacrifice with leavened bread” (<i>ibid.</i> xxiii. 18), the leaven must be removed before the time in which the Passover was
offered.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10546src" href="#xd32e10546">67</a>
</p>
<p>The law forbidding <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חמץ‎</span> “leavened bread,” to be kept in the house during Passover is frequently and most
emphatically repeated in the Torah. Jews have therefore, as a rule, been very conscientious
and zealous in the fulfilment of this Divine command. In accordance with this law,
the following observances have been ordained:—
</p>
<p>(1.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בדיקת חמץ‎</span> “the searching for leavened bread” on the eve of the 14th of <i>Nisan</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10570src" href="#xd32e10570">68</a> The head of the family, or his deputy, examines his residence thoroughly, and keeps
the <i>chamets</i>, which he has found, in a safe place till the next morning. This searching, like
every other performance of a religious duty, is preceded by a blessing, viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו על ביעור חמץ‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy <span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>commandments, and hast commanded us concerning the removal of the leavened bread.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10582src" href="#xd32e10582">69</a>
</p>
<p>(2.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביעור חמץ‎</span>, “the removal or the destruction of <i>chamets</i>.” All the <i>chamets</i> that is left after the first meal on the 14th of <i>Nisan</i> must be removed, <i>i.e.</i>, sold or given as a present to a non-Israelite, or destroyed. In addition to the
actual removal or destruction of <i>chamets</i>, a solemn declaration is made by the head of the family, that if any <i>chamets</i> should be left in his house without his knowledge, he would not claim it as his.
The object of this declaration is to free the master of the house from all responsibility
in case any <i>chamets</i> should be found on his premises, contrary to the Law.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10621src" href="#xd32e10621">70</a>
</p>
<p>(3.) Utensils which have been used for <i>chamets</i> are put away, and replaced by new ones, or by such as have exclusively been kept
for Passover. Some vessels used during the year may be used for Passover, after having
undergone a certain process called <i>kasher</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10638src" href="#xd32e10638">71</a> <i>i.e.</i>, “fitting” them as vessels for use on Passover.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb379a">[<a href="#pb379a">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>(4.) Although the articles of food that are directly forbidden as <i>chamets</i> are very few, there are a great many things that contain an admixture of <i>chamets</i>, and those “who fear the word of the Lord” use during Passover only those articles
of food concerning which there is no doubt whatever that they are perfectly free from
<i>chamets</i>. Articles of food for Passover are therefore only bought of persons who can be trusted
to hold these observances in respect.
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.6.2.1">In addition to the commandments of the Passover-offering and the unleavened bread,
there is a special duty, mentioned four times in the Pentateuch, for the Israelite
to relate to his children the history of the departure from Egypt, and to explain
to them the meaning of the several rites connected with the celebration of Passover.
This duty is called <i>haggadah</i>, “relating,” and a service has been arranged for the purpose, called <i>Seder</i>, “the Order.” The first two evenings of Passover are therefore called “<i>Seder</i>-evenings,” and the book which contains this Service is generally called <i>Haggadah</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>Seder</i>-service contains four elements: (1) the relation of the deliverance of the Israelites
from Egypt; (2) the festive meal, preceded by <i>Kiddush</i> and the partaking of bitter herbs and unleavened bread, and followed by Grace; (3)
<i>Hallel</i> and other hymns; (4) the partaking of four cups of wine (<i>arba kosoth</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10680src" href="#xd32e10680">72</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb380a">[<a href="#pb380a">380</a>]</span></p>
<p>The head of the family or his substitute who reads the Service has before him on the
table: (1) three unleavened cakes (<i>matsoth</i>);<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10722src" href="#xd32e10722">73</a> (2) bitter herbs and <span class="pageNum" id="pb381a">[<a href="#pb381a">381</a>]</span>other vegetables;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10777src" href="#xd32e10777">74</a> (3) salt water, in which the vegetables (<i>karpas</i>) are dipped before they are eaten, and <i>charoseth</i>, a mixture of apples, almonds, various spices, especially cinnamon, and wine, in
which mixture the bitter herbs are dipped;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10800src" href="#xd32e10800">75</a> (4) a bone with some meat on it and an egg,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10809src" href="#xd32e10809">76</a> both roasted.
</p>
<p>The order of the Service is indicated in most <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>editions of the <i>Haggadah</i> in rhymed Hebrew as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter rtl" dir="rtl">
<p class="line"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדש ורחַץ . כרפס יחַץ . מגיד רחַץ . מוציא מצָה.‎</span> </p>
<p class="line"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלחן ערֵךְ . מרור כרֵךְ . צפון ברֵךְ . הלל נרצָה׃‎</span> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">The following is the explanation of these lines:—
</p>
<p>1. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדש‎</span> Say <i>Kiddush</i>. See above, page 379.
</p>
<p>2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רחץ‎</span> “Wash,” <i>scil.</i>, your hands.—Only the head of the family does so at this part of the Service.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10849src" href="#xd32e10849">77</a>
</p>
<p>3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כרפס‎</span> “Vegetables.” A piece of parsley or salad or bitter herb is dipped in salt water,
and eaten after the recitation of the blessing: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … בורא פרי האדמה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast created the fruit of the ground.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10864src" href="#xd32e10864">78</a>
</p>
<p>4. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יחץ‎</span> “He divides.” Of the three <i>matsoth</i> before him, the head of the family breaks the middle one, part of which is laid aside,
to be eaten at the end of the meal.<span id="xd32e10874"></span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10875src" href="#xd32e10875">79</a>
</p>
<p>5. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מגיד‎</span> “Relating,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10891src" href="#xd32e10891">80</a> <i>scil.</i>, the history of the departure <span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>from Egypt. The reader, pointing to the broken <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span> before him, exclaims, “Such was the bread of poverty which our forefathers ate in
the land of Egypt;” as if to say, “We are all alike descendants of those who ate the
bread of poverty in Egypt.” In the same sense, the reader continues, “We all alike
should rejoice in the kindnesses shown by the Almighty to our nation, and all alike
should seek and find true comfort in the hope of the Messianic blessing promised by
Him for the future.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10907src" href="#xd32e10907">81</a> One of the company, usually the youngest, puts to the reader four questions, as formulated
in the paragraph beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מה נשתנה‎</span> “Why is different?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10913src" href="#xd32e10913">82</a> Additions and alterations may, of course, be made by the inquirer according to his
knowledge and intellect. The object of these questions is to obtain an explanation
of the rites that distinguish this evening from others. In answer to these questions,
the reader refers to the past history of Israel in three different forms,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10919src" href="#xd32e10919">83</a> viz.:—
</p>
<p>(1.) The first answer begins, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבדים היינו‎</span>, “We were <span class="pageNum" id="pb384a">[<a href="#pb384a">384</a>]</span>slaves;” and ends, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בשעה שיש מצה ומרור מונחים לפניך‎</span> “When unleavened bread and bitter herbs lie before thee.” Here the reader restricts
himself, without any comment, to the one fact that our forefathers were at first slaves
in Egypt, and were then delivered, and illustrates the duty of speaking that night
more fully concerning the departure from Egypt, by precedent, by the authority of
the Mishnah, and by the Midrashic interpretation of the law commanding us to tell
our children this event.
</p>
<p>(2.) The second form of the answer begins, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתחלה עבדי עבודה זרה היו אבתינו‎</span> “Our forefathers were at first worshippers of idols,” and ends, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצילנו מידם‎</span> “delivers us out of their hand.” Here the exodus from Egypt is described as the fulfilment
of the promise made by God to Abraham, that his descendants would be delivered out
of the hands of their oppressors.
</p>
<p>(3.) The passage from Deut. xxvi. 5–8 is recited with its Midrashic interpretations,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10952src" href="#xd32e10952">84</a> and in conclusion all the benefits received by the Israelites from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>departure from Egypt till the building of the Temple are enumerated, and our duty
of gratitude is shown.
</p>
<p>In all these three forms no notice has been taken of the particular questions. Rabban
Gamaliel insists that this should be done, and a section is therefore added, containing
the explanation why the Passover-offering, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs
were to be eaten; this, like the three other sections, concludes with the emphatic
declaration that we—after so many generations—are still bound to praise and to thank
God for the benefits bestowed upon our nation so long ago. Hereupon follows the <i>Hallel</i>, of which the first two paragraphs, containing special reference to the departure
from Egypt, are sung before supper; the first part of the Seder-Service concludes
with a blessing, in which we praise God for our past deliverance and pray for the
approach of our future redemption.
</p>
<p>6. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רחץ‎</span> “Washing.” All those who partake of the meal wash their hands, as is ordinarily done
before meals.
</p>
<p>7. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוציא מצה‎</span>. Two pieces of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span> are taken; one piece, broken off the whole cake, representing the bread eaten at
ordinary meals for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוציא‎</span>, and the other piece taken from the broken one, representing the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span> we are commanded to eat on the Seder-night. Before eating the two pieces two blessings
are recited <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … המוציא לחם מן הארץ‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who bringest forth bread from the earth,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו ּּּ על אכילת מצה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast commanded
us to eat <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10990src" href="#xd32e10990">85</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb386a">[<a href="#pb386a">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>8. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מרור‎</span> “Bitter herb.” Bitter herbs dipped in <i>charoseth</i> are eaten, after the following blessing has been recited <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו … על אכילת מרור‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast commanded
us to eat bitter herbs.”
</p>
<p>9. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כורך‎</span> “Combining;” <i>scil.</i>, unleavened bread and bitter herbs; these are eaten together, just as formerly, in
the time of the Temple, Hillel used to eat together meat of the Passover-offering,
unleavened bread, and bitter herbs (Exod. xii. 8; Num. ix. 11).
</p>
<p>10. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלחן עורך‎</span> “Table laid.” The evening meal is taken.
</p>
<p>11. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צפון‎</span> “Laid aside.” The meal is concluded with a piece of the half <i>matsah</i> that has been laid aside at the beginning of the Service. It is called <i>afikuman</i>, “dessert.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11033src" href="#xd32e11033">86</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span></p>
<p>12. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברך‎</span> “Say grace.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11061src" href="#xd32e11061">87</a>
</p>
<p>13. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלל‎</span> “<i>Hallel</i>.”—The rest of <i>Hallel</i> is sung, followed by Ps. cxxxvi., and the whole of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשמת‎</span> with the concluding blessing.—The fourth cup of wine is then taken, and the usual
prayer after the partaking of wine is recited.
</p>
<p>14. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נרצה‎</span> “Completed.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11087src" href="#xd32e11087">88</a>—The Seder-Service is <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>completed; it concludes with a prayer for the rebuilding of the Temple and the restoration
of Israel to Zion. The prayer seems to have been originally the conclusion of a <i>Piyyut</i> or liturgical poem on the Passover Sacrifice.
</p>
<p>The <i>Haggadah</i> contains, besides, several hymns and songs, of which the following are found in the
ordinary editions of the work:—
</p>
<p>1. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויהי בחצי הלילה‎</span> “And it was in the middle of the night.” The author reflects on the various marvellous
events in our history that happened in the night-time.
</p>
<p>2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ואמרתם זבח פסח‎</span> “And ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of Passover.” A song referring to wonderful
events which, according to Tradition, took place on Passover.
</p>
<p>3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כי לו נאה‎</span> “To him praise is seemly.” A praise of God as the only Being worthy to be called
King and Ruler.
</p>
<p>4. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדיר הוא‎</span> “He is mighty.” A praise of God, and an expression of hope that He will soon rebuild
the Temple.
</p>
<p>5. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחד מי יודע‎</span> “One, who knows?” A popular song enumerating persons and objects in Jewish History
and Tradition, as well as in Nature according to numbers up to thirteen, with the
object of emphasising the Unity of God.
</p>
<p>6. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חד גדיא‎</span> “One kid.” A popular song that illustrates the working of Divine Justice in the history
of mankind.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Passover as an agricultural feast was kept “in the season of the month of ripeness”
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למועד חדש האביב‎</span>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>when the barley sown in the winter had become ripe. On the second day of Passover
an offering was brought of “the beginning of the harvest;” it consisted of an <i>omer</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11139src" href="#xd32e11139">89</a> of barley (Lev. xxiii. 9 <i>sqq.</i>). Before this offering was presented it was not allowed to eat of the new corn (<i>ibid.</i> 14).
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.6.2.2">From the bringing of the <i>Omer</i> to “the harvest feast” the days are counted, viz., forty-nine days, and the fiftieth
day is the feast of harvest (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חג הקציר‎</span>), or “the day of the first-fruit offering” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הבכורים‎</span>).
</p>
<p>The counting commences on the second evening. It is done either immediately after
<i>Maarib</i>, or later on during the Seder-Service; it is preceded by the following blessing:
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו … על ספירת העומר‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast commanded
us … to count the days of the <i>Omer</i>.” The following is the way of counting: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היום יום … לעומר‎</span> “This day is the first day since the <i>Omer</i>.” From seven upward the number of weeks is likewise expressed,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11173src" href="#xd32e11173">90</a> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היום יום … שהם … שבועות … לעומר‎</span> “This day completes … that is … weeks … since the offering of the <i>Omer</i>.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The celebration of Passover serves to inculcate into our hearts the first principle
of our faith: the existence of God, the Supreme Being who rules the whole universe,
in whose hand are the destinies of kings and peoples, whose power was recognised by
the Egyptians when they were punished for their misdeeds, <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>and whose might was seen by the Israelites when He divided the Red Sea for them, and
fulfilled the Divine promise made to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
</p>
<p>The season of Passover, in which we celebrate our liberation from earthly taskmasters,
is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמן חרותנו‎</span> “The season of our freedom.” The deliverance from Egypt, the first step leading to
the fulfilment of the promise, “And I will take you unto me for a people,” has been
poetically conceived as the betrothal of Israel to God, and in the <i>Piyyut</i> for Passover ample use has been made of this idea. It has further found expression
in the custom of reading the Song of Solomon on the first <i>Sabbath</i> after the first two days of Passover, and by some also on the Seder-evening after
the conclusion of the ordinary Service.
</p>
<p>The Service is, in general outline, the same as on Sabbath. It consists of <i>Maarib</i>, <i>Shacharith</i>, <i>Musaph</i>, and <i>Minchah</i>. The Morning-Service includes <i>Hallel</i>, the reading of the Law, and Lessons from the Prophets (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קריאת התורה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הפטרה‎</span>). The following sections, containing description of, or reference to, Passover or
to the departure from Egypt, are read consecutively on the eight days: Exod. xii.
21–51, on the Passover celebrated by the Israelites in Egypt; Lev. xxii. 26 to xxiii.
44, on “the seasons of the Lord;” Exod. xiii., xxii. 24 to xxiii. 19, and xxxiv. 1–26:
Num. ix. 1–14, on the second Passover; Exod. xiii. 17–xv. 26, the crossing of the
Red Sea; Deut. xv. 19 (on Sabbath, xiv. 22) to xvi. 17 contains laws referring to
the three Festivals. On <i>Sabbath chol-ha-moëd</i>, Exod. xxxiii. 12 to xxxiv. 26.—In addition to these sections <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>verses from Num. xxviii.–xxix., referring to the sacrifices prescribed for each day
of the Festival, are read from a second <i>sefer</i>.
</p>
<p>The Lessons from the Prophets are the following:—Josh. v. (preceded in the German
Ritual by iii. 5–7), on the first Passover kept by the Israelites in Palestine; 2
Kings xxiii. 1–9 and 21–25, on the Passover celebrated in the days of King Josiah;
2 Sam. xxii., the song of David after deliverance from his enemies, a parallel to
the Song of Moses; Isa. x. 32—xii., on the defeat of Sennacherib, and the blessings
of the Messianic days. According to Tradition the defeat of Sennacherib took place
on Passover; moreover, the celebration of the deliverance from Egypt suggests the
reflection on the final Redemption of Israel. The Lesson from the Prophets chosen
for <i>Sabbath chol-ha-moëd</i> is taken from Ez. xxxvi. 1–14. The prophet sees in a vision how the dry bones of
the dead are awakened to fresh life by the Will and the Spirit of the Lord: a precious
lesson for us, designed to strengthen our hope of a revival of every good and noble
idea, though for the present it be dormant within us. Nature around us awakening to
fresh life in the spring supplies a parallel to the vision of Hezekiel.
</p>
<p>The <i>Machzor</i> (lit. Cycle) or Prayer-book for the Holy-days contains numerous additions to the
ordinary prayers. They are called <i>Piyyutim</i>, and vary according to the custom and the taste of the congregation. The <i>Piyyut</i> added in the second paragraph of the <i>Musaph-amidah</i> on the first day of Passover is called <i>tal</i>, “dew,” or prayer for dew; the rain season having come to an end, we <span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span>pray that the vegetation may, during the hot season, be refreshed by the regular descent
of the dew. The praise for “sending down rain” in the same paragraph, viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם‎</span>, “Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall,” is discontinued after the
<i>shacharith</i> prayer of the first day of Passover. In the Portuguese Ritual the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוריד הטל‎</span>, “Thou causest the dew to fall,” are introduced instead.
</p>
<p>Similarly, there is an additional prayer for rain (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גשם‎</span>) in the <i>Musaf</i> of <i>Shemini-atsereth</i>. The time chosen for these prayers is in accordance with the meteorological conditions
of Palestine. This custom, however, does not exclude the addition of prayers for rain
or dew, according to the needs of the country in which we live.
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.6.2.3"><i>The Days of the Counting of the Omer</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ימי הספירה‎</span>
</p>
<p>The period from Passover to the Feast of Weeks is full of sad memories of massacres
of Jews that took place in the days of the Crusades; also of the miseries that befell
the Jews in Palestine in the days of the Emperor Hadrian. During the month of <i>Iyar</i>, the Jews abstain from rejoicings and weddings,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11271src" href="#xd32e11271">91</a> with the exception of the 18th of the month, which is the 33rd of the <i>Omer</i>, because, according to Tradition, a plague that had raged among the disciples of
Rabbi Akiba ceased on that day. The 18th of <i>Iyar</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל״ג בעומר‎</span> is therefore called “the scholars’ festival.”

<h4 class="main"><i>The Feast of Weeks</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבועות‎</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Feast of Weeks</i> is celebrated on the fiftieth day<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11295src" href="#xd32e11295">92</a> of the <i>Omer</i> (Lev. xxiii. 16); <i>i.e.</i>, the 6th of <i>Sivan</i>. It is, in the first place, “the feast of harvest,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חג הקציר‎</span> (Exod. xxiii. 16), especially of the wheat, and “the day of the first-fruit offering,”
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הבכורים‎</span> (Num. xxviii. 26). The first sacrifice of the new corn was offered: “the bread of
the first-fruit,” which was to serve as an expression of gratitude for the blessing
of the harvest. In the absence of sacrifices in our days, the custom widely prevails
of adorning the Synagogue and the home with plants and flowers, in order that the
sight of these beautiful objects might awaken and strengthen feelings of gratitude
toward the Almighty for His loving-kindness. Each one of the plants and flowers reveals
a special form of the Creator’s wisdom, power, and goodness.—The feast is called Feast
of Weeks, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חג השבעות‎</span> (Deut. xvi. 10), on account of the completion of the seven weeks counted from the
day of the <i>Omer</i>.
</p>
<p>The Feast of Weeks, the 6th and the 7th of <i>Sivan</i>, commemorates also an historical event: the Law-giving on Mount Sinai. It is therefore
called “the season of the giving of our Law,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמן מתן תורתנו‎</span>.
</p>
<p>As Passover has been poetically called the day of Israel’s betrothal to God, the Feast
of Weeks would <span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>correspond to the wedding-day, and the counting of the <i>Omer</i> does thus not only connect two harvest-feasts, but represents the longing of the
bride for the day of her complete happiness; <i>i.e.</i>, the longing of the Israelites for the Divine Revelation, which was to complete the
work of their deliverance from Egypt.
</p>
<p>The celebration of the Feast of Weeks thus involves the second principle of our faith:
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה מן השמים‎</span> “The belief in the Divine origin of the Law,” or “Divine Revelation.”
</p>
<p>On the first day we read Exod. xix.–xx., the account of the Law-giving on Mount Sinai,
and Ez. i., the first vision of the prophet Ezekiel, in which the glory of God is
revealed to him. On the second day Deut. xv. 19 (on Sabbath, xiv. 22) to xvi. 17;
and Hab. iii., “the prayer of Habakkuk,” in reference to God’s Revelation as the Ruler
of the universe.—There is also the custom to read the Book of Ruth, which contains
the account of Ruth’s embracing the true faith, and a description of the harvest and
the treatment of the poor in the harvest-season.
</p>
<p>There is a custom among some of our brethren to employ the first night of the Feast
in preparing themselves for the coming celebration of the giving of the Law. The greater
part of the night is spent in reading passages from the Scriptures and from the Talmudical
books.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11342src" href="#xd32e11342">93</a> The custom has its basis in the preparation commanded by God to be made during “the
three days of bordering” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלשת ימי הגבלה‎</span>) which preceded the Law-giving (Exod. xix. 10–12).

<div class="div3 last-child section" id="ch2.4.6.4">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>The Feast of Tabernacles</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סכות‎</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The fifteenth day of this seventh month (<i>Tishri</i>) shall be the Feast of Tabernacles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סכות‎</span>) for seven days unto the Lord” (Lev. xxiii. 34). The name has its explanation in
the commandment, “Ye shall dwell in booths seven days” (<i>ibid.</i> 42); “that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell
in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (ver. 43). We are thus commanded
to commemorate the travelling of the Israelites through the wilderness. They dwelt
in tents, that gave them shelter to some extent; but without the Divine protection
this shelter would have proved insufficient. Of this twofold shelter and protection
we are reminded by the tabernacle in which the Law commands us to dwell during the
Festival.
</p>
<p>In fulfilment of this commandment we make booths (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סכות‎</span>). The chief difference between a booth and an ordinary house consists in the mode
and in the material employed for roofing the two structures. For the <i>succah</i> must not be covered with fixed boards and beams or with canvas, but with detached
branches of trees, plants, flowers, and leaves, in such a manner that the covering
is not quite impenetrable to wind and rain, or starlight. During the Festival the
<i>succah</i> is our dwelling-house, in which we take our meals, study, receive our friends, and,
if possible, enjoy rest and sleep. If, on account of the severity of the climate,
the constant dwelling in the <i>succah</i> threatens to prove injurious to our health, we content ourselves with taking our
meals in the <i>succah</i>. Before each meal <span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>we recite the blessing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו … לישב בסוכה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast commanded
us to dwell in the booth.” The first time we are in the <i>succah</i> we add the blessing, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהחינו‎</span> (p. 358).
</p>
<p>The Festival is, secondly, called “the Feast of Ingathering,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חג האסיף‎</span>. The produce of the fields and gardens have been gathered in, and the people rejoice
before the Lord in gratitude for the blessings which He has granted to them. “And
ye shall take unto you on the first day the fruit of the goodly tree, branches of
palm-trees, and boughs of thick-leaved trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall
rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Lev. xxiii. 40). In accordance with
the traditional interpretation of this verse, we take four kinds of plants (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ארבעה מינין‎</span>), viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אתרוג‎</span> “the citron;” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לולב‎</span>, “a branch of the palm-tree;” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הדסים‎</span>, three “myrtle branches;” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערבות‎</span>, two “branches of the willow.” According to a <i>Midrashic</i> interpretation, they represent four different types of plants, that which has a pleasant
fragrance and a beautiful form (<i>esrog</i>); the beautiful in form, but without fragrance (<i>lulabh</i>); that which smells pleasantly, but is inferior in form (<i>hadassim</i>); and that which has neither a goodly form nor an agreeable fragrance (<i>arabhoth</i>), as if to say that we are thankful to God for all that He has given us, although
to our mind some of these seem imperfect in comparison with others.
</p>
<p>In obedience to this commandment we take, every day of <i>Succoth</i> except Saturday,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11430src" href="#xd32e11430">94</a> the above four kinds <span class="pageNum" id="pb397a">[<a href="#pb397a">397</a>]</span>into our hands, hold them during the recitation of the <i>Hallel</i>, and make with them a procession round the Synagogue,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11451src" href="#xd32e11451">95</a> while singing the hymns called <i>hoshaanoth</i> (so called on account of the repeated occurrence of the word <i>hoshaanah</i> in them).
</p>
<p>Before taking the <i>arbaah minim</i> into our hands we say the following blessing: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו … על נטילת לולב‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast commanded
us to take the <i>lulabh</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11474src" href="#xd32e11474">96</a> On the first day <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהחינו‎</span> is added.
</p>
<p><i>Succoth</i> lasts seven days, the last five days being half Holy-days, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חול המועד‎</span>. The seventh day is called <i>Hoshaana-rabba</i>, because on that day many prayers beginning with <i>hoshaana</i> are offered up, during the <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>chanting of which seven processions round the Synagogue are made.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11501src" href="#xd32e11501">97</a>
</p>
<p>The Feast of Tabernacles is closely followed by “the feast of the eighth day,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמיני עצרת‎</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11526src" href="#xd32e11526">98</a> which, like all other Festivals, is kept two days. The second day is, in addition,
called “Rejoicing of the Law,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמחת תורה‎</span> <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>because on this day the reading of the Pentateuch is completed and recommenced.
</p>
<p>The nine days of the Festival are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמן שמחתנו‎</span> “The season of our rejoicing,” and it is the third principle of our faith, the belief
in Divine Providence, that this Festival impresses on our hearts. On the one hand,
we have the rejoicing and the four species of plants as proofs and tokens of Divine
blessing; and, on the other hand, the <i>succah</i> is a symbol of human frailties and imperfections. Thus, in all our rejoicings we
should remember that our abode on earth is not permanent, and that all earthly happiness
is like the plants that easily fade away. In order to impress this idea on our mind,
we read the book of <i>Koheleth</i> on <i>Sabbath chol-ha-moëd</i> or on <i>Shemini-atsereth</i>.
</p>
<p>The following portions are read from the Pentateuch: Lev. xxii. 26 to xxiii. 44<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11574src" href="#xd32e11574">99</a> (on the first two days); Exod. xxxiii. 12 to xxxiv. 26 (on <i>Sabbath chol-ha-moëd</i>); Deut. xiv. 22 to xvi. 7 (on the eighth day); Deut. xxxiii. to end of Pentateuch;
and Gen. i. 1 to ii. 3 (on <i>Simchath Torah</i>). In addition, the paragraph of the sacrifices of the day (Num. xxix. 12–39) is read
<span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>from a second <i>sefer</i>. The Lessons for <i>chol-ha-moëd</i> are taken from the same passage.
</p>
<p>The Lessons from the Prophets are the following: Zech. xiv., prophecy on the future
of Israel and on the punishment of those who would not come to Jerusalem to celebrate
there the <i>Succoth</i> Festival; 1 Kings viii. 2–21, on the opening of the new Temple; on <i>Sabbath chol-ha-moëd</i>, Ez. xxxviii. 18 to xxxix. 16, on the war with Gog; 1 Kings viii. 22–66, prayer of
Solomon on the eighth day of the services for the consecration of the Temple; Jos.
i., accession of Joshua to the leadership of Israel.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ימים נוראים‎</span> “solemn days,” we understand the first ten days of the month <i>Tishri</i>, especially their beginning and their end: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ראש השנה‎</span>, “New-year,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום כפור‎</span> “the Day of Atonement.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11621src" href="#xd32e11621">100</a>
</p>
<p>It is customary to prepare for the “solemn days” during the month of <i>Elul</i>, by additional prayers, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סליחות‎</span> “forgiveness,” after or before the Daily Service, and by blowing the <i>shofar</i> at the close of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb401a">[<a href="#pb401a">401</a>]</span>Daily Service.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11645src" href="#xd32e11645">101</a> According to the Portuguese Ritual, the <i>Selichoth</i> begin on the 1st of <i>Elul</i>, and are continued <span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span>morning and evening till the Day of Atonement. The German Ritual has <i>Selichoth</i> only in the Morning Service; they begin on the Sunday before New-year, and if the
Festival is on Monday or Tuesday, on the second Sunday before, and end on the Day
of Atonement. The blowing of the <i>shofar</i> takes place in the German Synagogues during the month of <i>Elul</i>, in the Portuguese <span class="corr" id="xd32e11704" title="Corrected by author from: during the penitential days">this custom is not practiced</span>.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first and the second days of <i>Tishri</i> are kept as New-year.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11718src" href="#xd32e11718">102</a> In accordance with the command, “The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt
bring unto the house of the Lord thy God” (Exod. xxxiv. 26), we devote the first ten
days of the year as an offering to the Lord; they are days of increased devotion,
earnest self-examination, and new efforts to lead a good, virtuous, and godly life.
They are called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשרת ימי תשובה‎</span> “ten days of return” to God, or “ten penitential days.”
</p>
<p>We greet and congratulate each other on New-year, using the phrase, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לשנה טובה תכתב‎</span>—or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לש׳ ט׳ תכחבי, תכתבו<span class="corr" id="xd32e11737" title="Not in source">,</span> תכתבנה‎</span> according as a male, a female, several males, or several females are addressed—“May
you be inscribed for a happy year.” It is a figurative expression, borrowed from the
writing and signing of decrees by earthly judges.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Bible the Festival is not called New-year,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11743src" href="#xd32e11743">103</a> but <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום תרועה‎</span> “Day of blowing the <i>shofar</i>” (Num. xxix. 1); and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכרון תרועה‎</span> “Memorial of the blowing of the <i>shofar</i>” (Lev. xxiii. 24); in our prayers the names <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הזכרון‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הדין‎</span> “Day of Remembering” and “Day of Judgment,” are also used.
</p>
<p>The first of these four names implies, according to the traditional interpretation,
the commandment of blowing the <i>shofar</i>. As a rule the <i>shofar</i> is blown during the Morning Service before the sefer is returned to the Ark, and
during <i>Musaf</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11774src" href="#xd32e11774">104</a> The blowing of the <i>shofar</i> is expressed by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תרועה‎</span>, which denotes the sound of an alarm; hence we learn that the <i>shofar</i> is intended to awaken us, and to call us forth to range ourselves under our banner.
It is an ideal banner, the worship of God and faith in Him, that we are called upon
to protect and to defend from enemies without and within.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11795src" href="#xd32e11795">105</a> Prominence is therefore given in our Service for New-year to the proclamation of
God as King of the universe, and to our longing for the time when all mankind will
unite in the worship of the One God.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span></p>
<p>The name “Memorial of blowing the <i>shofar</i>” indicates that we are to remember some historical event suggested by the sound of
the <i>shofar</i>. We are reminded of the period when the Israelites, encamped round Mount Sinai, on
hearing the Divine message, “Ye shall be my peculiar people,” “a kingdom of priests,”
and “a holy nation,” joyfully replied, “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do”
(Exod. xix. 8). The <i>shofar</i> thus awakens us to greater watchfulness and activity in the purification and sanctification
of our heart.
</p>
<p>The third name, “Day of Memorial,” seems to be a modification of the second; but it
has a more general meaning. The second name, that reminds us of our duty as God’s
peculiar people, suggests also the idea that God, who declared us to be His people,
watches over us; that what we do, we do in His presence. He perceives, notes, and
remembers all our deeds, words, and thoughts. When, therefore, we appeal to the goodness
of Him, who remembers all His creatures and provides for the wants of every one of
them, we must not forget that He is also just. This idea, again, suggests the fourth
name, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום הדין‎</span> “Day of Judgment,” the day on which we are judged according to our deeds, both our
merits and our shortcomings being taken into account.
</p>
<p>The essential elements in our Service are the three sections in the <i>Amidah</i> of <i>Musaf</i>: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכיות‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכרונות‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שופרות‎</span>. They chiefly refer to the three fundamental principles of our religion: (1) Existence
of God, a Being that is King of the universe; (2) Divine Justice, and (3) Revelation.
Ten passages are quoted <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>from the Bible in support of each of these principles.
</p>
<p>Tradition has fixed the 1st of <i>Tishri</i> as the date of several events in the history of Israel, <i>e.g.</i>, the birth of Isaac, the binding of Isaac (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עקדה‎</span>), and the birth of Samuel (B.&nbsp;T. Rosh ha-shanah 10<i>b</i>). Hence Gen. xxi. and xxii. are read on the two days of New-year, in addition to
the paragraph on the sacrifices of the Festival (Num. xxix. 1–6).
</p>
<p>From the Prophets, we read on the first day 1 Sam. i. 1 to ii. 10, on the birth of
Samuel, and the prayer of Hannah praising the justice of God; on the second day, Jer.
xxxi. 2–20, a prophecy concerning the restoration of Israel.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11845src" href="#xd32e11845">106</a>
</p>
<p>The Sabbath between New-year and the Day of Atonement is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת שובה‎</span> because the <i>haphtarah</i>, taken from Hosea (xiv. 1 <i>seq.</i>), commences with the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שובה‎</span> and is an exhortation of Israel to return to God.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 last-child section" id="ch2.4.7.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום כפור‎</span> “<i>Day of Atonement</i>.”</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tenth day of the seventh month, <i>Tishri</i>, is the most important of all the Holy-days. It is the Day of Atonement, on which
“God will forgive you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before
the Lord” (Lev. xvi. 30).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Ye shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
in all your dwellings. It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
yourselves: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate
your sabbath” (Lev. xxiii. 31, 32).
</p>
<p>The Day of Atonement is therefore a day of resting, fasting, prayer, and spiritual
improvement.
</p>
<p>It is a day of rest, and the prohibition of work is the same as on the ordinary Sabbath.
</p>
<p>The fasting begins the 9th of <i>Tishri</i>—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערב יום כפור‎</span>—about sunset, and lasts till the beginning of night on the following day. The phrase,
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ועניתם את נפשתיכם‎</span> “Ye shall afflict yourselves,” is explained by Tradition to signify the total abstinence
from all kinds of food and the gratification of other bodily desires (Mishnah, Yoma
viii. 1). The reason of this commandment may be the following: The principal source
of sin is the gratification of our bodily appetites; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תשובה‎</span> “return” to the right way must therefore include the earnest attempt to control,
and when necessary to suppress, such appetites. Fasting is such an attempt. But it
must be borne in mind that fasting is only one of the duties we have to fulfil on
the Day of Atonement, and that the other duties are equally essential.
</p>
<p><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תשובה‎</span> “return,” is the principal object of the celebration of the Day of Atonement; it
implies the following four steps:—
</p>
<p>1. <i>Consciousness of sin</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ידיעת החטא‎</span>. We must again and again examine ourselves and try to discover our failings; our
actions and our words must pass in review, and we must remember that, however good
we may <span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>be, no man is righteous upon earth “that doeth good and sinneth not” (Eccles. vii.
20).
</p>
<p>2. <i>Confession of sin</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ודוי‎</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11913src" href="#xd32e11913">107</a> On the discovery of sin, we must have the courage to confess our guilt before him
against whom we have sinned; if it is against God alone that we have sinned, we make
silent confession before Him; if we find ourselves guilty of an offence against our
fellow-man, we must confess our sin to him.
</p>
<p>3. <i>Regret</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חרטה‎</span>. Having discovered and confessed our sin, we should feel pain and remorse, alike
for the evil we have done and for the good we have left undone.
</p>
<p>4. <i>Amendment</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עזיבת החטא‎</span>. The regret should be followed by a firm resolve to abandon the way of evil, and
not to sin again, even if occasion be given for a repetition of the sinful act.
</p>
<p>There are five Services on the Day of Atonement:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="#pb408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p>(1) Evening Service, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעריב‎</span>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11954src" href="#xd32e11954">108</a> (2) Morning Service, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שחרית‎</span>; (3) Additional Service, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוסף‎</span>; (4) Afternoon Service, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנחה‎</span>; (5) Concluding Service, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נעילה‎</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11987src" href="#xd32e11987">109</a>—The <span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>confession of sin, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ודוי‎</span> is the most essential and characteristic element in the Services of the Day of Atonement.
</p>
<p>In the Morning Service we read Lev. xvi., and Num. xxix. 7–11, on the sacrifices on
the Day of Atonement; in the Afternoon Service, Lev. xviii., on forbidden marriages.
The Lessons from the Prophets are: in the morning, Isa. lvii. 14–lviii. 14, on our
duties on the fast-day; in the afternoon, the Book of Jonah, illustrating the effect
of sincere repentance, and Micah vii. 18–20, on Israel’s repentance.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 25th of <i>Kislev</i> we begin to celebrate eight days of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חנוכה‎</span> or Dedication, in commemoration of the victories of the Maccabees over Antiochus
Epiphanes, king of Syria. Antiochus had attempted to force the Jews to idolatry, and
to make them abandon the worship of the true God. The Jews, led by the Maccabees,
resisted, and, armed with faith in God, gained the victory over large armies of the
enemy. The Temple, which had been defiled by the heathen soldiers, was again purified,
and the Service of God re-established. <span class="pageNum" id="pb410">[<a href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>For lighting the continual lamp (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נר תמיד‎</span>) pure oil was wanted, that had not been touched by the heathen. Only a small cruse
of pure oil was found, which was believed to be sufficient for one night; but it sufficed
for eight days, by which time a fresh supply could be procured.
</p>
<p>The Feast of Dedication commemorates the victory of the faithful over the faithless,
of the true religion over idolatry, of light over darkness, and is celebrated—
</p>
<p>(1.) By lighting <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חנוכה‎</span> lights, one on the first evening, and adding one light each successive evening, so
that on the eighth evening eight lights are kindled.
</p>
<p>(2.) By giving expression to our feeling of gratitude in psalms (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלל‎</span>) and prayers of thanks (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על הנסים‎</span>).
</p>
<p>In the Morning Service a few verses from Num. vii., on the dedication of the Altar,
are read. On <i>Sabbath Chanuccah</i>, Zechariah’s vision, Zech. ii. 10 to iii. 7, including the vision of the golden candlestick,
is read as <i>haphtarah</i>; and if there happen to be a second <i>Sabbath Chanuccah</i>, 1 Kings vii. 40–50, a description of the various vessels and ornaments in the Temple
of Solomon is read on that Sabbath.
</p>
<p class="small"><span class="sc">Note 1.</span>—The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חנוכה‎</span> lights remind us, in the first place, of the reopening of the Temple and the resumption
of the regular Temple Service. But they are also intended to remind us of the light
of our holy faith, which Antiochus Epiphanes attempted in vain to extinguish. For
it shed forth its light again, and shone brighter and brighter every successive day.
We thus learn that when our religion is imperilled, firmness against temptation or
force is sure to lead to success and victory.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פורים‎</span> or “Feast of Lots,” is celebrated on the 14th and the 15th of <i>Adar</i> (second <i>Adar</i> in a leap-year), in commemoration of the defeat of Haman’s wicked plans. Haman was
chief minister to Ahasuerus, king of Persia, and planned to kill all the Jews in the
Persian Empire, but the Almighty frustrated his designs through the agency of Mordecai
and his cousin Esther. The Feast is called <i>Purim</i>, that is, “lots,” because Haman had cast lots in order to discover the day most favourable
to his plans.
</p>
<p>We celebrate <i>Purim</i>—
</p>
<p>(1.) By reading twice, once during the Evening Service and once during the Morning
Service, the Book of Esther (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מגלת אסתר‎</span>), which contains the history of Haman’s plans and their frustration. The reading
is preceded by the following blessing: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … אשר קדשנו … על מקרא מגלה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast commanded
us to read the <i>Megillah</i>.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך … שעשה נסים לאבותינו בימים ההם בזמן הזה‎</span> “Blessed art thou … who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in days of old at this
season,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהחינו‎</span>.
</p>
<p>(2.) By giving presents to our friends (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משלוח מנות‎</span>) and gifts to the poor (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתנות לאביונים‎</span>).
</p>
<p>(3.) By a festive meal (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת פורים‎</span>). Comp. Esth. ix. During the Morning Service the account of the war with Amalek is
read from Exod. xvii. 8–16.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 15th of <i>Adar</i> is called <i>Shushan Purim</i>, because the Jews in <i>Shushan</i> continued to fight against the enemy on the 14th of <i>Adar</i>, and kept <i>Purim</i> on the 15th. The 13th of <i>Adar</i>, being the day appointed for the slaughter of the Jews, is now kept as a fast-day,
and is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תענית אסתר‎</span> “the Fast of Esther.”

<h4 class="main"><i>The Four Fasts</i>.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are four days kept as fast-days in commemoration of events connected with the
fall of Jerusalem. They are called in the Bible (Zech. viii. 19) “the fast of the
fourth month and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh and the fast of
the tenth.” These days are the anniversaries of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem
(10th of <i>Tebeth</i>), of the breach made in the wall (17th of <i>Tammuz</i>), of the destruction of the Temple (9th of <i>Ab</i>), and of the murder of Gedaliah (3rd of <i>Tishri</i>). The 9th of <i>Ab</i> is kept as a day of fasting and mourning for the destruction of the Temple. According
to Tradition, both the first and the second Temple were destroyed on the same day.
</p>
<p>The Lesson from the Pentateuch read in the Morning and in the Afternoon Services on
the fast-days is Exod. xxxii. 11–14 and xxxiv. 1–10. On the 9th of <i>Ab</i> this section is read in the afternoon only; the Morning Lesson being Deut. iv. 25–40
and Jer. viii. 13 to ix. 23; in the Afternoon Service on all fasts Isa. lv. 6 to lvi.
8 is read as <i>haphtarah</i>.
</p>
<p class="small"><span class="sc">Note 1.</span>—These fasts begin with daybreak, except the fast of the 9th of <i>Ab</i>, which commences with the previous evening and lasts twenty-four hours, and is in
all respects like that of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb413">[<a href="#pb413">413</a>]</span>Day of Atonement. During the day the Lamentations of Jeremiah, various elegies called
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קינות‎</span>, “Lamentations,” and the Book of Job are read. On the Fast of <i>Ab</i>, as a sign of mourning, <i>talith</i> and <i>tefillin</i> are not worn during the Morning Service. They are, however, put on for the Afternoon
Service.
</p>
<p class="small">2. The Sabbath preceding the Fast of <i>Ab</i> is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת חזון‎</span>, and the Sabbath following, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבת נחמו‎</span> because the <i>Haphtaroth</i> on these Sabbaths (ch. i. and ch. xl. of Isaiah) begin respectively with the words
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזון‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נחמו‎</span>; the one containing rebukes and threats, the other a message of comfort.
</p>
<p id="ch2.4.8.4">Besides these historical fasts, there are voluntary fasts observed by some as an expression
of deep-felt piety; <i>e.g.</i>, the three fasts of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שני חמישי ושני‎</span> of Monday, Thursday, and Monday, kept after the festive seasons of Passover and Tabernacles,
in imitation of Job, who after the days of feasting sanctified his sons, and brought
special sacrifices (Job i.). To this class of fasts may be reckoned the day before
New-moon, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יום כפור קטן‎</span> on which in some congregations the Afternoon Service is enlarged by propitiatory
prayers.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.5.1" class="first">In the Midrash the following legend is related: When, at the conclusion of the seventh
day, the sun had set and darkness had spread over the earth, Adam was afraid that
the world was now coming to an end. But the Almighty caused him to find two stones,
by means of which he produced light. On seeing this Adam was full of joy, and although
he had himself produced the spark, he felt that it was to his Creator and Master that
thanks were due, and gave expression to his feelings in the words, “Blessed art Thou,
O <span class="pageNum" id="pb414">[<a href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who createst the light of the fire.”
</p>
<p>Thus the legend traces the beginning of Divine Worship to the first man; and, in fact,
the desire to commune with the Creator and to give outward expression to the inner
feeling of reverence and allegiance is so general that it seems to be part of man’s
nature.
</p>
<p>In a different way this feeling was expressed by the sons of Adam, by Cain and Abel.
They brought presents to the Lord, probably accompanied by words of praise and prayer.
No essential difference is noticed by us in the offerings of the two brothers; each
of them brought what seemed best in his eyes. And yet the offering of Cain was rejected,
whilst that of Abel was received favourably. An important lesson it is that Scripture
teaches here at the very threshold of the history of sacrifices. It is this: The value
of an offering does not lie in its outward appearance, in that which is open to man’s
judgment, but in something that is known to the Omniscient alone, in the heart of
him who approaches his Creator with a gift, in the motives which prompt him to do
so, and in the feelings which accompany that act. From these beginnings the two forms
of Divine Worship, Sacrifice and Prayer, gradually developed.
</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.5.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Sacrifice</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנחה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קרבן‎</span>).</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What was the main idea that prompted man to bring an offering to the Almighty? He
felt, as it were, the existence of a higher Being, the Creator and Ruler of all things;
he was conscious that his own life <span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>and welfare depended on the Will of the Being to whom in reality everything belongs
that man believes himself to possess and to enjoy. In order to give expression to
this feeling of allegiance man brought the first and best of what he had acquired
to the true Owner, and thus introduced<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12248src" href="#xd32e12248">110</a> himself by such gifts as a faithful subject who is anxious to merit the favour of
his Master. That which was at first introduced by man voluntarily, was afterwards
sanctioned and regulated by Divine command.
</p>
<p>There were two kinds of sacrifices: bloodless sacrifices, <i>minchah</i> and <i>nesech</i>, “flour-offering” and “drink-offering,” and blood sacrifices: animal-offerings. But
no difference is discernible between these two kinds with regard to their importance,
sanctity, and efficiency. As a rule, the animal-offering was supplemented by <i>minchah</i> and <i>nesech</i>. The treatment of sacrifices varied according as they were intended to express the
feeling of reverence, rejoicing, gratitude, or repentance, and special rules had to
be observed in each case, the various kinds of sacrifice being <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולה‎</span> “burnt-offering,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלמים‎</span> “peace-offering,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תודה‎</span> “thanksgiving,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חטאת‎</span> “sin-offering,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשם‎</span> “guilt-offering.” The Law further fixed the place, the time, and the method of sacrificing,
and appointed also the persons who alone were allowed to attend to this function,
so that no strange element, no <span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>idolatrous or superstitious customs, could be introduced into the sacrificial service
ordained by the Law.
</p>
<p>Great stress is laid on the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice upon the altar.
“The blood,” the Law says, “is the soul of all flesh; and I have given it to you upon
the altar to make an atonement for the soul” (Lev. xvii. 11). We are thus reminded
that, in so far as the animal life is concerned, “the pre-eminence of man over the
beast is nought,” and yet the Creator gave us the right to shed the blood of animals
in order to save our life. Why? Because man has a higher mission to fulfil; he has
been created in the image of God.
</p>
<p>These and similar reflections were suggested by the different elements constituting
the sacrificial rite. With the destruction of the Temple sacrifices ceased; with the
Restoration of Israel and the Rebuilding of the Temple the Sacrificial Service will
likewise be resumed. (Comp. Mal. iii. 4). There are persons who believe that the Sacrificial
Service, implying much of anthropomorphism, could not have been intended to be permanent,
and that it was only a concession made to the fashion and the low degree of culture
of the age. Those who reject sacrifices on this account must also reject prayer, which
is likewise based on a certain degree of anthropomorphism, though less strikingly
than sacrifice. If the law concerning offerings were only intended for a certain age,
such limitation would have been indicated in the Law. In the absence of such indication
we have no right to criticise the Word of God, and to think that we are too advanced
in culture to obey the Divine commands, It has been further argued that, <span class="pageNum" id="pb417">[<a href="#pb417">417</a>]</span>according to Maimonides and his followers, the laws concerning sacrifices only served
as a means of counteracting the idolatrous tendencies of the age. But Maimonides never
went so far as to contend that these laws have served their purpose, and are now null
and void. Even those laws which have been enacted by human authority remain in force
till they are repealed in a regular and legal manner. But what human being can claim
a right to abolish laws given by the Almighty? Whether any of the laws of the Torah
will ever be abrogated we do not know, but we are sure that, in case of such abrogation
taking place, it will be done by a revelation as convincing as that on Mount Sinai.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the revival of the Sacrificial Service must likewise be sanctioned
by the divine voice of a prophet. The mere acquisition of the Temple Mount or of all
Palestine by Jews, by war, or political combinations, or purchase, would not justify
the revival. It is only the return of the Jews to Palestine, and the rebuilding of
the Temple by Divine command and by Divine intervention, that will be followed by
the restoration of the Sacrificial Service. And however contrary the slaughter of
animals, the sprinkling of their blood, and the burning of their flesh be to our taste,
we ought to look forward with eagerness and pleasure for the revival of the full Temple
Service as an event that will enable us to do the Will of the Almighty revealed in
the Torah. Instead of modelling the Divine laws according to our liking, we ought
rather to regulate the latter according to the teaching of Scripture, and suppress
it when contrary to the express Will of God. We therefore give <span class="pageNum" id="pb418">[<a href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>expression to our hope “for the restoration of the Temple with its ancient Service”
in frequent and fervent prayers, and in accordance with the exhortation of Hosea (xiv.
2) we read each day during the Service Scriptural passages referring to the sacrifice
of the day.
</p>
<p>“Sacrifices have been condemned by prophets and psalmists”! But in the passages which
seem antagonistic to sacrifices only those sacrifices are referred to which are brought
in a wrong spirit or from bad motives. (Comp. 1 Sam. xv. 22; Isa. i. 11–13, xliii.
24, lxvi. 2; Jer. vii. 21; Hosea vi. 6; Amos v. 25; Ps. l. 8.)

<h4 class="main"><i>Prayers</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה‎</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12306src" href="#xd32e12306">111</a></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Prayer is the general name for that form of Divine Worship which is expressed in words;
it has a wider scope than sacrifices, for it is not limited to a special place, or
to a certain time, or to one privileged family. It is accessible to all, in all places
and at all times. All alike are addressed by the Psalmist, “Let everything that hath
breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord” (Ps. cl. 6).
</p>
<p>There is no direct commandment in the Torah concerning prayer; it is rather assumed
as a matter of course, and as inseparable from our belief in God. According to Tradition
(Sifre on Deut. xi. 13), the exhortation to serve God with all the heart implies the
duty of prayer. “What duty depends on the heart? It is the duty of prayer.” (Comp.
Maim. Mishneh-torah, <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>Hilchoth Tefillah i. 1.) The following are a few of the general rules laid down by
our Sages with regard to Prayer:—
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.3.1">“Better little with devotion (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כונה‎</span>) than much without devotion” (Shulchan-aruch, Orach Chayyim i. 4).
</p>
<p>“During prayer bear in mind before whom you stand” (Babyl. T., Berachoth 28<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p>“The value of the words uttered with the lips is determined by the devotion of the
heart” (Babyl. T., Berachoth 15<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p>What is devotion? The concentration of all our attention upon the words we utter,
the banishment of all foreign thoughts from the mind, and the consciousness that we
stand in the presence of the Almighty, whom it is our duty to love, fear, and obey.
A prayer uttered in this frame of mind is called “a prayer without lips of deceit”
(Ps. xvii. 1). Comp. Maim., <i>l. c.</i>, iv. 15.
</p>
<p>It is a matter of course that indecorous conduct, unbecoming attitudes, and the like
cannot harmonise with true devotion. With regard to language, form, time, and place
of prayer nothing was fixed originally; all was regulated by the momentary impulse
of the heart of the worshipper. But people who considered themselves incapable of
giving adequate expression to their devotional feelings borrowed the words of those
more capable than themselves and followed their leading. Such a course was also necessary
for common and united devotion. When a certain prayer or a certain order of Service
was frequently repeated at the same season and in the same place, the form, the time,
and the place of prayer became to a certain degree fixed by custom—<span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span><i>minhag</i>—and that which had in the beginning been voluntary (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות‎</span>) was subsequently made law or duty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חובה‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12349src" href="#xd32e12349">112</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.3.2">The <i>minhag</i> is a most important element in Jewish religious life. What one has been accustomed
to do for a long time, or even from his earliest youth, is deeply impressed on the
heart, and is not readily surrendered. Such customs are sometimes more cherished and
more firmly adhered to than express precepts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12359src" href="#xd32e12359">113</a> <a id="ch2.5.3.3"></a>It is the outcome of this respect for custom that in all countries the Jews pray in
Hebrew. But nevertheless the general principle remains in force that it is not the
language that determines the value of prayer but “the devotion of the heart,” and
those who do not understand Hebrew may give expression to “the devotion of their heart”
in the language they understand and speak. Women, who as a rule were not expected
to be Hebrew scholars, used to read translations of the Hebrew prayers in the vernacular
instead of, or in addition to, the original; they had also prayers composed for them
in the vernacular (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תחנות‎</span>). And in more ancient times, when the Jews of Babylon had adopted the Aramean dialect
spoken in that country, and retained it also after their return to Palestine, many
prayers were composed in the more familiar <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>language, although Hebrew was retained for the principal prayers. Hebrew has a special
claim to privilege and distinction among the Jews. It is our national language, which
our forefathers once spoke; it is the language in which the Almighty addressed the
prophets, and through them the Israelites; the language in which God revealed His
Will to the Israelites on Mount Sinai; the language in which the holy Psalmist sang
the praises of the Creator, the priests blessed the people, and worshippers prayed
in the Temple at Jerusalem. It must be the pride of every Jew to be enabled to pray
at home, and especially in the Synagogues, in that same language, and if Hebrew be
not the language of his every-day life, he should seek to perfect his knowledge of
it to such an extent that he shall be able to understand the prayers and to pray with
his whole heart. Those who seek the abolition of Hebrew in our Services aim, consciously
or unconsciously, at the destruction of our nationality as the people of the Lord,
by breaking asunder one important link which connects us with the wonderful past of
our nation.
</p>
<p>Equally indifferent with regard to the value of prayer are its length and its form.
The Bible offers examples for all kinds and lengths of prayer. If one wishes to pray
in a few words, he need only follow the example of Moses, who in the moment of anguish
uttered nothing beyond the words, “O God, heal her now” (Num. xii. 13). If one prefers
a long prayer, he may also take Moses as a guide, who prayed forty days for the forgiveness
of the Israelites after they had made the golden calf (Deut. ix. 18, 25). Both prayers
<span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span>were equally efficacious. Miriam was healed, and the Israelites obtained pardon. With
regard to the form, we have in the Bible prayers in prose and in poetry; some uttered
in simple speech, others in song; some with musical accompaniment, some without it.
All of them seem to have been at first the response to a momentary impulse, but were
afterwards repeated on similar occasions in the original or in a modified form.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.3.4">Among the various motives that impel us to seek communion with our Father, is the
desire for certain things which we have not, and the conviction that it is solely
in His hand to fulfil our wishes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12377src" href="#xd32e12377">114</a> A genuine prayer of this kind—for the fulfilment of certain wishes of ours—is impossible
without the belief in the efficacy of prayer. We cannot with certainty expect that
our petition will be granted, but we hope that it will; we submit our wishes to the
Will of the Almighty. The Hebrew name for prayer <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה‎</span> implied the idea of judgment, as if we judged <span class="corr" id="xd32e12388" title="Corrected by author from: that">whether</span> the concession of our petition might fairly be anticipated. Such judgment, however,
is not to be considered as decisive; and if our request is to be granted, it will
be as an act of mercy and grace (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רחמים ותחנונים‎</span>), and not because it is a claim fully proved (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבע‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12398src" href="#xd32e12398">115</a> We hope that our prayer will be granted, but never lose sight of the condition “if
it please God.” There are a few exceptional cases. Prophets like Moses (Exod. viii.
6), Samuel (1 Sam. <span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span>xii. 17), Elijah (1 Kings xviii.), Elisha (2 Kings iv. 33 <i>sqq.</i>), and others, men inspired by the Almighty, were, on certain occasions, sure of the
effect of their prayer. In the Mishnah (Taanith iii. 8) the case of Choni (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חוני המעגל‎</span>) is mentioned, who spoke with certainty of the result of his prayer. It must, however,
in the latter case be added that the head of the Sanhedrin, Shimeon ben Shatach, blamed
him for his conduct.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4">This we know for certain, that whenever and wherever we respond to an inner impulse
by the utterance of a prayer, God is near us, for “He is nigh unto all them that call
upon him, to all that call upon him in truth” (Ps. cxlv. 18); that we and the place
on which we stand are hallowed by the Divine Presence. Places once hallowed by such
devotion, whether of our own or of our fellow-men, we like to visit again and again
for the same purpose. The spot of Jacob’s first communion with God thus became “the
house of God;” and even during the period when there was one central Sanctuary for
the Sacrificial Service in Israel, at Gilgal, Mizpah, Shiloh, and later in Jerusalem,
there were houses of God throughout the country for devotion unaccompanied by sacrifices.
These were “the meeting-places of God” (Ps. lxxiv. 8), in which the Israelites assembled
to meet their Creator. Such houses of God were established wherever Jews settled;
their main purpose was united devotion; but they served also many other purposes—in
fact, every holy, good, and noble cause. The house of God was the Assembly-house,
Synagogue (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית הכנסת‎</span>), in which the affairs of the community (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צרכי צבור‎</span>) were settled; <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>the young had there their school, adults came there for religious instruction, and
found there opportunity for the study of the Law, and the poor and stranger received
there support and hospitality.
</p>
<p>In a Jewish Synagogue there were two important features, the platform (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בימה‎</span>) and an ark (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תבה‎</span>) containing scrolls of the Law. From the platform in the middle of the Synagogue,
the lessons from the Pentateuch and the Prophets were recited, and everything else
that was directly or indirectly addressed to the congregants. But prayers addressed
to the Most High were offered up from a lower place near the Holy Ark,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12427src" href="#xd32e12427">116</a> in accordance with the words of the Psalmist (cxxx. 1), “Out of the depth have I
cried unto thee, O Lord.”
</p>
<p>The Ark, or Holy Ark (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ארון‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ארון הקדש‎</span>), in almost all modern Synagogues—in places west of Jerusalem—occupies the middle
of the east side of the Synagogue. In the time of the Talmud the Synagogues were to
some extent made to resemble the Tabernacle which the Israelites built in the wilderness
or the Temple in Jerusalem. The entrance was from the east, and the Ark, which was
to represent the Most Holy, was in the west. The Ark was, like the original one, movable.
It was called <i>tebhah</i>, lit. “box,” in order to distinguish it from the original. The recess in which it
was kept was the <i>Hechal</i> or <i>Kodesh</i>, “The Holy.” The <i>tebhah</i> seems to have served both as a <span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>receptacle for the scrolls of the Law, and as a desk on which these were put whenever
they were required for the reading of the Torah. On certain extraordinary occasions,
when, on account of the absence of rain, a general fast was ordered, the <i>tebhah</i>, with a <i>Sefer-torah</i> on it, was carried into the street,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12459src" href="#xd32e12459">117</a> where a special service was held.
</p>
<p>The reason why the entrance to the Sanctuary and to the Synagogues was from the east,
and the worshippers consequently stood during prayer with their face toward the west,
may, according to the Mishnah (Succah v. 4), be explained thus: The principal prayer
of the day being that in the morning, the Jews, as a protest against the sun-worship
of the idolaters, who at that hour were accustomed to greet the sun with their prayer,
turned away from the east and offered up their prayer to the Almighty in the opposite
direction. When sun-worship had ceased, probably after the destruction of the second
Temple, the national grief and hope found expression in the custom of praying toward
the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. Hence the Jews who live west of Jerusalem stand during
prayer with the face toward the east, while those east of Jerusalem turn westward.
This custom is, besides, supported by the following passage from the prayer of King
Solomon: “And they pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their
fathers, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span>city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name” (1 Kings
viii. 48).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12466src" href="#xd32e12466">118</a>
</p>
<p>In most Synagogues there is a continual lamp (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נר תמיד‎</span>) burning. It is a Biblical institution, but only designed for the Sanctuary; its
presence in the Synagogue is of comparatively modern date. The <i>ner tamid</i> of the Sanctuary, however, is explained to be a lamp burning “from evening to morning”
(Exod. xxvii. 21). A golden candlestick standing in the Sanctuary against the south
side, with its seven branches arranged from east to west, served this purpose. According
to Tradition it was the second branch, counting from east to west, which really burnt
continually; but this was not considered as implied in the term <i>ner tamid</i>, which only meant “a continual lamp” in the sense of a lamp that burns <i>regularly</i> every night.
</p>
<p>The <i>ner tamid</i> in the Synagogue, which burns continually day and night, is not mentioned by any
of the earlier Rabbinical authors. It has been introduced as a symbol representing
our conviction that from the Synagogue shall continually come forth the light of instruction,
the light of comfort and blessing, and the light of love and peace.
</p>
<p>In the Synagogue women are separated from men. There was also in the Temple an <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עזרת נשים‎</span> “court of the women,” distinguished from the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עזרת אנשים‎</span> “court of the men,” to which women had no access. During the Feast of Tabernacles,
when the great rejoicings in the Temple attracted a large assembly, special care was
taken (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תקון גדול היה שם‎</span>) that the separation of the sexes should be maintained (Mishnah, Succah v. 2; and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb427">[<a href="#pb427">427</a>]</span>Talm. B., Succah 51<i>b</i>). This precedent has been followed in the Synagogue, and has been accepted as law
up to this day.
</p>
<p>Reservedness and modesty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צניעות‎</span>) have always been the pride and ornament of Jewish women, both in their homes and
in the Synagogue; hence also their taking a silent part in the public devotion is
an honour to them, and by no means derogatory.
</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned points, a Synagogue ought to be distinguished by
the greatest possible simplicity, by the absence of all kinds of images, portraits,
or statues representing living beings, whether real or imaginary. The Jewish religion
is void of every visible symbol; and the so-called <i>magen-david</i> (the double triangle) is probably not of Jewish origin, and has no connection with
our holy religion. It is not a symbol of this kind, but some inscription of a passage
from the Scriptures that in most houses of worship reminds us of the sacredness of
the place. We enter it with due reverence, manifesting it outwardly, in our peculiar
traditional manner, by keeping the head covered. It is our ancient custom to cover
the head when engaged in prayers, in reading the Bible or Talmud and their commentaries.
This outward sign serves to remind us that not only our Service but even our literature
is something holy, and its study a religious act (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוה‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12513src" href="#xd32e12513">119</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.1">Before we proceed to describe the details of our <span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span>ritual, we mention one important point in which the present Synagogal Service differs
from the ancient Service in the Temple. From what we are told in the Scriptures and
in the Talmud, we learn that instrumental music was an essential element in the Service,
and that King David and his successors paid great attention to it, whilst, with a
few exceptions, it is almost entirely absent from our Synagogues. The principal reason
why instrumental music is excluded from the Synagogue is its prohibition on Sabbaths
and Holy-days by Rabbinical law (Babyl. T., Erubin 104<i>a</i>). This prohibition, like many other enactments, did not apply to the Temple Service;
for the sacrificial laws had to be obeyed, irrespective of the fact that they involved
acts which, if performed apart from the Temple Service, would constitute a breach
of the Sabbath laws. Apart from the Temple Service the Sabbath laws remained in full
force for the priests as well as for the general public.
</p>
<p>There were also other considerations that helped to keep instrumental music out of
the Synagogue Service. Its absence, though not directly a sign of mourning, served
to preserve the memory of the destruction of the Temple, and to strengthen our longing
for its restoration. It is also urged that the introduction of instrumental music
into the Service would not satisfy any real want of Jewish worshippers, but would
merely be a concession to the desire to assimilate our Divine Service to that of our
non-Jewish neighbours, contrary to the prohibition of <i>chukkoth haggoyim</i> contained in the words, “Ye shall not walk in their statutes” (Lev. xviii. 3), <i>i.e.</i>, in the statutes of the Gentiles. But, on <span class="pageNum" id="pb429">[<a href="#pb429">429</a>]</span>the other hand, it has been argued that the feeling once expressed by the nation in
the words “This is my God, and I will worship him in a beautiful manner” (Exod. xv.
2), still animates us. It is said that it is our duty to make our Service as beautiful
and as attractive as possible. This argument deserves consideration, and might even
outweigh some of the above-mentioned arguments against the introduction of music into
our Service, if we were sure of the result of such introduction. But this is by no
means the case, for the experiment, where tried, has not been successful if judged
by the most practical test. The number of worshippers has not been increased, and
discontent has not been removed. Whether the devotion of the worshippers has been
improved, refined, or intensified by music is a question that cannot be answered with
certainty. Even if the answer were satisfactory, it could only apply to the introduction
of instrumental music into our Service on week-days, on Friday evening before the
commencement of Sabbath, but not on Sabbaths and Holy-days.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.2"><i>The Ritual.</i>
</p>
<p>In the Bible there is no indication of a fixed ritual; there are, however, a few instances
of forms of prayer prescribed for certain occasions. There is the priests’ blessing
(Num. vi. 24–26); the thanksgiving on bringing the first-fruit offering to the Temple
(Deut. xxvi. 3–10); prayer on distributing the tithes which accumulated in three years
(<i>ibid.</i> 13–15). David (Ps. lv. 18) says, “Evening, and morning, and at <span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span>noonday do I pray;” Daniel “kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and
gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime” (Dan. vi. 11); but nothing is said
about the form and the contents of these prayers. The Mishnah first speaks of certain
fixed forms of prayer: the “Eighteen” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמונה עשרה‎</span>), the reading of <i>Shema</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קריאת שמע‎</span>), and Benedictions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות‎</span>). The composition of the <i>tefillah</i>, “Prayer” <i>par excellence</i>, is attributed to the Men of the Great Synagogue (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אנשי כנסת הגדולה‎</span>), but only in its outlines. The number of the paragraphs, the theme of each paragraph,
and the formula by which it is concluded may then have been fixed, the rest being
left to be filled up by each supplicant according to his capacity. It was but natural
that prayers uttered repeatedly by men eminent for their piety should be eagerly copied
by others, and gradually become, to some extent at least, fixed forms of prayer. The
<i>tefillah</i>, however, in the time of the Mishnah was by no means identical with the <i>tefillah</i> of the Men of the Great Synagogue. The destruction of the Temple necessitated several
changes; <i>e.g.</i>, the prayers for the welfare of Jerusalem, for the prosperity of Israel and of the
Holy Land, and for the acceptance of the Service in the Temple were altered in accordance
with the new state of affairs.
</p>
<p>The Mishnah speaks of the <i>tefillah</i> as a well-known existing institution; it seems that it was the regular prayer in
the Synagogue Service, and the discussion whether the <i>tefillah</i> should be repeated every day <i lang="la">in extenso</i> or in an abbreviated form (Mishnah, Berachoth iv. 3) refers probably to the prayer
recited <i>privatim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלת יחיד‎</span>), and not to the Service in the Synagogue. <span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>The prescribed “Eighteen Blessings” were the framework, into which each man was expected
to fit in his peculiar, individual supplications; whilst in the public Service the
<i>tefillah</i> remained uniform. In the days of Rabban Gamliel of Jamnia, and with his sanction,
an important addition was made by Samuel: a prayer for the discomfiture of those who
by slander, denunciation, or other wicked means attempt to undermine the existence
of the Jewish religion and community (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת הצדוקים‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת המינים‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12595src" href="#xd32e12595">120</a> In some congregations two other paragraphs (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏את צמח‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ולירושלם‎</span>) were at the same time combined into one, in order to keep to the traditional “Eighteen
Blessings.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12605src" href="#xd32e12605">121</a>
</p>
<p>The reading of <i>shema</i> in the evening and in the morning, the three sections constituting the <i>shema</i>, and the order of these sections, are assumed in the Mishnah as fully established
by law and usage. Only a few regulations are discussed concerning the time and the
mode of the reading. There was this difference between the custom of the Babylonian
Jews and that of their brethren in Palestine, that the latter omitted in the evening
the passage referring to <i>tsitsith</i>. Later on, however, the Palestine Jews conformed to the Babylonian custom. Suggestions
have been made <span class="pageNum" id="pb432">[<a href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>to substitute other Biblical passages for <i>shema</i>, but they have been rejected. Several attempts have been made to introduce, as an
addition to the three sections of <i>shema</i>, the reading of the Decalogue; the addition was disallowed, lest people should be
misled to think that the Ten Commandments alone were to be observed, and that the
other laws were not binding (Babyl. T., Berachoth 12<i>a</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12629src" href="#xd32e12629">122</a>
</p>
<p>The Benedictions which precede and follow the reading of <i>shema</i> were fixed in the time of the Mishnah as regards number, order, and form; but the
contents were left unsettled for some time (Mishnah, Berachoth i. 4); in the Gemara
their wording is still a subject for discussion. The same can be said with regard
to the relative order of <i>shema</i> and <i>tefillah</i>. For the Evening Service the <i>tefillah</i> seems to have generally been considered as optional. As to Benedictions in general,
their obligatory character is assumed in the Mishnah as admitted by all, and only
their form seems to have been fixed by the regulations mentioned in Berachoth vi.–ix.
</p>
<p>The Mishnah (Megillah iii. 4–iv. 10) includes a number of regulations concerning the
reading of the Law, the Prophets, and the Book of Esther. Detailed rules were laid
down for the reader and the translator (<i>methurgeman</i>), pointing out which passages should be omitted in the translation, and which should
be omitted <span class="pageNum" id="pb433">[<a href="#pb433">433</a>]</span>even in the original. It seems that there was a regular, consecutive reading, which
was interrupted on extraordinary days by the reading of passages referring to these
days.
</p>
<p>The ritual which was adopted for the priests in the Temple was an abridged form of
the ritual then in general use. It was as follows: They commenced with a benediction—the
first of those which precede the <i>shema</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוצר אור‎</span>); then they read the Decalogue, <i>shema</i> (the three paragraphs), and three further benedictions, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמת ויציב‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבודה‎</span> (corresponding to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רצה‎</span> in our prayer), and the blessing of the priests (Mishnah, Tamid v. 1).
</p>
<p>A special ritual is also mentioned in the Talmud (Mishnah, Taanith iv. 2) for the
<i>Maamadoth</i> and the Fast-days.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12673src" href="#xd32e12673">123</a> There were four Services daily, as on the Day of Atonement. The principal feature
in the Service of the <i>Maamadoth</i> was the reading of the first chapter of Genesis.
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Talmud (about 500 <span class="asc">C.E.</span>) the essential parts of our present ritual were already in a settled state; the <i>shema</i> with the benedictions preceding and following, the <i>tefillah</i> with its variations for New-moon, Sabbath, and Holy-days, the reading from the Law
and the prophets, and <i>Hallel</i>. The <i>Seder</i> evening Service was complete in its main parts. <span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>Of the Benedictions (<i>Berachoth</i>) on various occasions both form and contents were fixed, and the rule was laid down
by Rabbi Meir (Berachoth 40<i>a</i>) that he who uttered a <i>berachah</i> in a form different from that fixed by our Sages has not fulfilled his duty (or,
according to Maimonides, Hilchoth Berachoth i. 5, is in error). Notwithstanding this
rule, however, changes were made; new benedictions were introduced and old ones discontinued.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12704src" href="#xd32e12704">124</a>—<i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Kedushah</i> seem to have formed part of the Service; of the latter the Talmud mentions the name,
of the former the response: “May his great Name be praised” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהא שמו הגדול מבורך‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהא שמיה רבא מ׳‎</span> (Comp. Babyl. Talm., Berachoth 3<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>In the next period, that of the <i>Geonim</i>, we meet with the complete <i>Siddur</i>, “Arrangement” or “Order” of Service for ordinary days, for Sabbaths and Festivals,
Benedictions for all occasions, and <i>Piyyutim</i> as optional additions. Such a <i>Siddur</i> was arranged by the Gaon Rabbenu <span class="corr" id="xd32e12740" title="Source: Saadia">Saadiah</span> (892–942), and another by the Gaon Rabbenu Amram (about 880). Henceforth the principal
prayers underwent only insignificant alterations. Of the next period the most important
<i>Siddurim</i> are those included in the Mishneh-torah, at the end of the second book, and that
contained in the <i>Machzor Vitry</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12748src" href="#xd32e12748">125</a>
</p>
<p>The additional prayers and <i>piyyutim</i>, being optional, varied according to the taste of each congregation and <span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span>its leaders; in course of time these variations became permanent; the same was the
case with minor changes, especially in the less essential elements of the Service,
and thus the various <i>Minhagim</i> (Rites) of the various congregations came into existence. The principal <i>Minhagim</i> of importance for us are: the Polish, the Sephardic, the German, and the Italian
Rites.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12769src" href="#xd32e12769">126</a> In the following description of the Ritual only the two rites adopted in the principal
Synagogues of the Anglo-Jewish congregations in England will be noted.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3"><i>Prayers at Fixed Times.</i>
</p>
<p>Although we constantly enjoy the blessings of God, the very breath we breathe being
the gift of our Heavenly Father, yet certain seasons of the day, of the week, of the
month, and of the year have been selected as especially fit for reminding us of God’s
kindness, and predisposing our heart to devotion. Thus in the day, morning, noon and
evening have been fixed for prayer; in the week, Sabbath; in the month, New-moon;
in the year, the Festivals.
</p>
<p>We have three daily Services: <i>Maaribh</i>, “Evening prayer;” <i>Shacharith</i>, “Morning prayer,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12785src" href="#xd32e12785">127</a> and <i>Minchah</i>, “Afternoon prayer.” On Sabbath, New-moon, and Festivals an “Additional prayer,”
<i>Musaf</i>, is inserted <span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span>between the Morning and the Afternoon Services, and on the Day of Atonement, <i>Neïlah</i>, “Concluding Service,” is added after <i>Minchah</i>.
</p>
<p>The two most essential elements in these Services are: (1) the Reading of <i>Shema</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קריאת שמע‎</span>), in the <i>Maaribh</i> and the <i>Shacharith</i>; (2) the <i>Tefillah</i> or <i>Amidah</i>, common to all the Services.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3.1">1. <i>The Reading of Shema.</i>
</p>
<p>In obedience to the precept, “Thou shalt speak of them,” <i>i.e.</i>, of “the words which I command thee this day—when thou liest down and when thou risest
up,” three sections of the Law are read daily in the morning and in the evening, viz.,
(1) Deut. vi. 4–9, beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמע‎</span> “Hear;” (2) <i>Ibid.</i> xi. 13–21, beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏והיה אם שמע תשמעו‎</span> “And it shall be if ye will diligently hearken;” (3) Num. xv. 37–41, beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויאמר יי‎</span> “And the Lord said.” The first section teaches the Unity of God, and our duty to
love this One God with all our heart, to make His Word the subject of our constant
meditation, and to instil it into the heart of the young.—The second section contains
the lesson of reward and punishment: that our success depends on our obedience to
the Will of God. This important truth must constantly be kept before our eyes and
before the eyes of our children.—The third section contains the commandment of <i>tsitsith</i>, the object of which is to remind us of God’s precepts: “Ye shall see it and remember
all the commandments of the Lord and do them, and that ye seek not after your own
heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>you remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.”
</p>
<p>The reading of the <i>shema</i> is preceded by two <i>berachoth</i>: (1) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוצר אור‎</span> Praise of the Creator for the regular sequence of day and night, light and darkness;
(2) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבה רבה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבת עולם‎</span> Praise of His goodness in giving us the Torah, and prayer for His assistance in the
study of the Torah. The <i>shema</i> is followed by a <i>berachah</i> on the Redemption of Israel; it contains a reflection on the last words of <i>shema</i>, “I am the Lord your God,” an expression of our faith in the truth of these words,
which strengthen our belief in the future Redemption of Israel.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12861src" href="#xd32e12861">128</a> In the Evening Service a second <i>berachah</i> follows, beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏השכיבנו‎</span>, and containing a prayer for protection during the night.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12874src" href="#xd32e12874">129</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3.2">2. <i>The Tefillah or Amidah.</i>
</p>
<p>The <i>Tefillah</i>, “Prayer” <i>par excellence</i>, is called <i>Amidah</i> (lit., “standing”), because the worshipper stands during the time he offers it up.
It is also called <i>Shemoneh-esreh</i>, “Eighteen,” because it contains on most occasions eighteen (or nineteen, comp. p.
431) paragraphs, each concluding with a benediction.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first three paragraphs contain praise of God’s goodness to us, the descendants
of the pious patriarchs (1), His omnipotence (2), and His holiness (3).
</p>
<p>The next thirteen paragraphs are petitions for our individual and national well-being.
For our individual well-being (4–9), namely, for reason and wisdom (4), assistance
in our endeavour to return to God (5), forgiveness of our sins (6), deliverance from
trouble (7), from illness (8), and from want (9).—For our national well-being (10–15),
namely, for the gathering of those who are scattered (10), under good leaders (11),
protected from the evil designs of our foes (12), for the support of the faithful
(13), the rebuilding of Jerusalem (14), and the advent of Messiah (15). The sixteenth
paragraph is a prayer that our petition may be accepted.—The last three paragraphs
include a petition for the re-establishment of Divine Service in the Temple of Jerusalem
(17), thanksgiving (18), and prayer for peace and prosperity (19). When the prayer
is finished we express the wish that our lips, from which prayer to God has come forth,
may not be defiled by unworthy language.
</p>
<p>On Sabbaths, Holy-days, and in every <i>Musaph</i> the thirteen middle paragraphs are replaced by one in which reference is made to
the characteristic feature of the day; in the <i>Musaph</i> of New-year three <i>berachoth</i> (p. 404) are substituted for the thirteen middle <i>berachoth</i> of the ordinary <i>tefillah</i>. The thirteen paragraphs have been eliminated in order that we should not be reminded
on Sabbath and Holy-days of our failings, wants, and troubles; that those seasons
should be <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>marked by a happier and more cheerful mood than ordinary days (<i>supra</i>, p. 354).
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3.3">There are two shorter forms of the <i>tefillah</i> for urgent occasions: the one is a substitute for the “Eighteen,” in which the middle
thirteen paragraphs are contracted into one; it is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הביננו‎</span> (the first word of this middle section), or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעין שמונה עשרה‎</span> “abstract of the ‘Eighteen.’ ” The other is a contraction of the Friday evening <i>tefillah</i>, and is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעין שבע‎</span> “abstract of the ‘Seven’ ” (<i>scil.</i>, paragraphs forming the <i>tefillah</i>), originally intended for those who were too late for the full Service.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12957src" href="#xd32e12957">130</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Each of the above Services ends with a prayer called after its initial word <i>alenu</i>, “It is our duty.” In this prayer we thank God that we have the privilege of proclaiming
His Unity, and express our hope to see the worship of the One God adopted by all mankind.
It is omitted between two Services following closely the one upon the other.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3.4">In addition to the above, the Service contains the following parts:—
</p>
<p>(1.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות השחר‎</span> “Blessings of the Morning,” forming the first part of the Morning Service. It contains
benedictions, reflections, and prayers suggested by the change from night to day,
from sleep to wakefulness, from rest to activity.
</p>
<p>(2.) <i>Psalms.</i>—Our Service contains various groups of psalms: chief among them the <i>mizmorim</i> or <i>pesuke dezimrah</i> (“songs” or “verses of song”), and <i>shir shel yom</i> (“song of the day”), in the Morning Service. The former include Ps. cxlv. to cl.,
some other psalms, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb440">[<a href="#pb440">440</a>]</span>the song of Moses (Exod. xv.). The latter correspond to the songs of the Levites in
the Temple, and consist of Ps. xxiv. (for Sunday), xlviii. (for Monday), lxxxii. (for
Tuesday), xciv. (for Wednesday), lxxxi. (for Thursday), xciii. (for Friday), and xcii.
(for Saturday).—The repetition of Ps. cxlv. three times a day, twice during <i>Shacharith</i> and once during <i>Minchah</i>, is an old <i>minhag</i> (Babyl. Talm., Berachoth, p. 4<i>b</i>).
</p>
<p>(3.) <i>Supplications</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תחנונים‎</span>) added in the Morning and the Afternoon Services after the <i>tefillah</i>.
</p>
<p>(4.) Readings from the Bible and Post-Biblical Sacred Literature, such as Num. vi.
22 <i>sqq.</i> (priests’ blessing); Gen. xxii. (binding of Isaac); Exod. xvi. (manna); Mishnah,
Peah i. 1, and Babyl. T., Shabbath 127<i>a</i>, in the earlier part of the Morning Service; and words of comfort (beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ובא לציון‎</span>) from the Prophets after the “Supplications.” Originally an exposition of the Written
and the Oral Law followed the “Supplications,” and concluded with Messianic prophecies,
recited in Hebrew and in the Chaldee Version.
</p>
<p>(5.) Biblical and Post-Biblical passages referring to the Sacrificial Service, in
the Morning and the Afternoon Services.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.3.5">In addition to the above Services, read either in the Synagogue or privately at home,
there is a special prayer read by us before retiring to rest. The chief element in
it is the first section of <i>shema</i>; hence the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קריאת שמע שעל המטה‎</span> “Reading of <i>shema</i> before going to bed.” Some psalms and supplications are generally added.

<p class="first">The following points mark off the Public Service from the various forms of private
prayer:—
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.4.1">(1.) <i>Kaddish</i>, “Sanctification,” a prayer for the universal sanctification of God’s name, which
will distinguish the age of Messiah. In the second part of the <i>Kaddish</i> we pray for the Messianic peace, and in the last sentence express our hope that it
may soon be granted.
</p>
<p>Formerly the <i>Kaddish</i> concluded the Service; at present it is recited at the end of the Service in its
full form (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדיש שלם‎</span> “the whole <i>Kaddish</i>”); the first half (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חצי קדיש‎</span> “half-<i>Kaddish</i>”) has its place at the end of a section of the Service—<i>e.g.</i>, after the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסוקי דזמרה‎</span> in the Morning Service; a third form is recited by mourners after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלינו‎</span> and after special hymns or psalms; it is the whole <i>Kaddish</i> with the omission of the sentence beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תתקבל‎</span>. It is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדיש יתום‎</span> “<i>Kaddish</i> of the orphan,” and is intended to express the mourner’s faith in God and his resignation
to His Will.—Sometimes a special <i>Kaddish</i>, called <i>Kaddish dirabbanan</i>, is recited after the reading of some Talmudic or Midrashic passages. It is the same
as <i>Kaddish shalem</i>, except that the sentence beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תתקבל‎</span> is replaced by a prayer for the welfare of the scholars, the Rabbis, and their pupils.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The feeling of our dependence on the goodness of God must constantly be present to
our mind. Whatever we enjoy, be it in the form of eating or drinking, or some pleasing
or remarkable sight, an agreeable smell, a festivity on a joyful event, or the performance
of a Divine commandment (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצוה‎</span>); whatever befall us, whether it be pleasant or unpleasant—all this we consider as
sent to us by the Will of the Almighty, and we express our conviction by a suitable
<i>berachah</i>. The general rule is thus laid down by our Sages: It is unlawful for man to enjoy
anything on earth without previously acknowledging by a <i>berachah</i> that God is the source whence the enjoyment is derived. For <span class="pageNum" id="pb443">[<a href="#pb443">443</a>]</span>different cases different forms of “blessings” have been fixed by our Sages. In some
cases the enjoyment is also followed by a prayer of thanksgiving, the most important
being the prayer after meals, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת המזון‎</span> “Benediction for food or Grace.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13141src" href="#xd32e13141">132</a> In the Mishnah it is called “Three Blessings” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש ברכות‎</span>), because it consisted originally of three paragraphs, each ending with a benediction.
The three paragraphs are the following: (1) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת הזן‎</span> (“Benediction commencing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הזן‎</span>”), in which we praise God’s providential care of all creatures. (2) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הודאה‎</span> “Thanksgiving,” or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת הארץ‎</span> (Benediction referring to Palestine). In this paragraph we offer thanks for our individual
sustenance, as well as for our national gifts: Palestine, the Covenant, and the Law.
(3) Prayer for the restoration of Zion and the rebuilding of the Temple (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בנין ירושלם‎</span>).—Subsequently a fourth paragraph was added (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הטוב והמטיב‎</span> “who is good and causes His creatures to be good”) in commemoration of the relief
given to the Jews after the close of the war with Hadrian.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13177src" href="#xd32e13177">133</a>—On certain occasions, <i>e.g.</i>, at a wedding repast, suitable additions are made. Besides these, various supplications
have been added in later times.
</p>
<p>There are various short forms of this <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת המזון‎</span>; the shortest is that for children, “Blessed be the Merciful, the Giver of this bread.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13189src" href="#xd32e13189">134</a>—When three grown-up male persons or more have their meal together, <span class="pageNum" id="pb444">[<a href="#pb444">444</a>]</span>a special introductory form is used, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמון‎</span> “summons to prayer,” one of the company acting as Reader, and the rest forming the
congregation.
</p>
<p>Another form of thanksgiving is the “Abstract of the Three Blessings” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעין שלש‎</span>), consisting of one paragraph which contains the whole of the Grace in a contracted
form, and is used after cake, wine, and the like.
</p>
<p>No restriction is enforced upon us if we desire on our part to give expression to
our feeling of gratitude and reverence toward the Almighty in our own words on occasions
not provided for in the ancient forms of benedictions and prayers. In order, however,
to make a distinction between the forms of obligatory <i>berachoth</i> fixed by our Sages and the optional ones introduced by ourselves, we do not employ
the words, “O Lord, our God, King of the Universe,” which are essential in the former.

</p>
<p>Among the different <i>minhagim</i> observed in the Synagogue the following are noteworthy:—The head is kept covered,
the hands uncovered; gloves are generally taken off before the beginning of the Service.
It was customary to spread forth the hands during prayer, and the phrase “spreading
forth the hands” is used in the Bible in the sense of “praying.” The priests still
raise their hands when pronouncing the blessing. Isaiah, rebuking those who prayed
to God without seeking purification from evil deeds, says, “And when you spread forth
your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers I will not
hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isa. i. 15). Following the example of the Psalmist,
“I will wash my hands in innocency, so will I compass thine altar” (Ps. xxvi. 6),
we wash our hands <span class="pageNum" id="pb445">[<a href="#pb445">445</a>]</span>before prayer, as a symbol of the duty of purifying our conscience from guilt before
approaching the Almighty with our petitions. We thus uncover our hands as if to say,
“The reproach of Isaiah does not apply to us; we have tried to free our heart and
our hands from guilt.”
</p>
<p>A custom frequently animadverted upon is the habit which many Jews have adopted of
swinging their bodies forward and backward during prayer. We consider it a more decent
way to stand or sit still when communing with the Supreme Being. Both ways find support
in the Talmud (Babyl. T., Berachoth 31<i>a</i>, and Shabbath 10<i>a</i>); whilst the one stands like “a servant in the presence of his master,” the other
gives way to his emotions and excitement. The <i>Magen Abraham</i>, on chap. xlviii. 4, says: “He who follows the one example is right, and he who follows
the other is likewise right: all depends on the devotion of the heart.” Rabbi Jehudah
ha-Levi in his <i>Cuzari</i> (Book II. chap. xli.) mentions and explains the custom of shaking during prayer.
The habit of accompanying the emotions of our heart by corresponding motions of our
body has produced the custom of raising the whole body upwards when uttering the word
“holy” in the <i>kedushah</i>.
</p>
<p>During <i>tefillah</i> we remain standing in the same place; at the end, when we have finished our petition,
we retire slowly a few steps backward; the same is done by the Reader during the last
paragraph of the <i>kaddish</i>. It is as if, our petition ended, we reverently withdrew from the heavenly King who
has given us audience during the prayer.
</p>
<p>We bend the knee, incline our head, and bow down on certain occasions during the Service,
but we do not kneel during prayer.—It has perhaps been avoided as an idolatrous practice,
with reference to Judges vii. 5.
</p>
<p>When the Ark is opened and the <i>Sefer</i> is taken out or put back, we stand and show our respect for the Word of God in various
ways. Some bow the head; others, considering this as worship, kiss the <i>Sefer</i>, or otherwise express their reverence.
</p>
<p>The traditional way in which the kohanim proceed to bless the people is this: they
remove their shoes, as the priests did who ministered in the Temple; water is then
poured over their hands by the Levites, the ablutions of the ancient priests being
thus imitated to some extent (see Exod. xxx. 20). It is a holy act, and is done in
the Synagogue generally in front of the Ark. <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>The priests ascend the steps of the <i>hechal</i> and wait till called upon by the Reader to pronounce the blessing. They turn toward
the congregation, spread forth their hands in the traditional manner, and cover head
and face with the <i>talith</i>, in order not to be disturbed in their devotion by the sight of the congregation
before them; the Reader dictates the words of the benediction to them to guard against
any mistakes being made by them. The congregation, giving special importance to each
word, add Biblical quotations and special supplications during the interval between
one word and the other. Of greater importance, however, is respectful listening to
the words uttered by the priests, and chanted by them <span class="corr" id="xd32e13262" title="Corrected by author from: is">in</span> a peculiar traditional tune. The priests turn to all directions while pronouncing
the blessing, expressing thereby that they would have no one excluded from the blessing.
</p>
<p>Some <i>kohanim</i> refuse to perform this duty, pretending or believing that they are unworthy to bless
the congregation. This is a mistake. Those who feel that they are unworthy must try
by improved conduct to render themselves worthy, but disobedience to the direct commandment
of the Divine Law is certainly not the beginning of improvement. Others object to
the singing, in which they are unable to join; others to taking off their boots. The
excuses are certainly insufficient. But as these two elements are less essential,
they might, if necessary, be dispensed with if the fulfilment of the commandment is
secured thereby.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.1">2. <i>On Page 439.</i>
</p>
<p>There are various parts in our Service which originally seem to have formed a substitute,
under certain circumstances, for a section of the Service or for the whole of it,
but were subsequently, when the circumstances altered, embodied as an integral part
of the Service in addition to the sections which they had replaced.
</p>
<p>In the Morning Service there is in the section called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות השחר‎</span> a prayer beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לעולם יהא אדם‎</span> and concluding <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לעיניכם אמר יי‎</span>. This prayer, preceded by an exhortation to be God-fearing in secret—when persecution
prevented public worship of God—contains an expression of pride in our history, and
of gratitude to God that we have the privilege to proclaim the <span class="pageNum" id="pb447">[<a href="#pb447">447</a>]</span>Unity of God in the words, “Hear, O Israel,” &amp;c., and a petition for the fulfilment
of the Messianic prophecies.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Maaribh</i> the part beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברוך יי לעולם‎</span> and ending <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על כל מעשיו‎</span> was originally a substitute for the <i>Amidah</i>, and the conclusion of the Evening Service for those who considered the <i>tefillah</i> in the evening optional. Similarly, on Friday evening the contracted <i>tefillah</i> was originally a substitute for the <i>tefillah</i> for those who came late. In both these and similar cases the substitute and its original
have been retained as integral parts of the Service.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.2">3. <i>On Page 442 (2).</i>
</p>
<p>In the public Service the <i>tefillah</i> is repeated by the Reader after the silent prayer (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בלתש‎</span>) of the congregation<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> This <i>minhag</i> must have been introduced very early. In the Talmud (end of <i>Rosh ha-shanah</i>) it is spoken of as a regular institution, its purpose is discussed, and the reason
stated why we should not dispense with the Reader’s repetition or with the silent
<i>tefillah</i>. It seems that there was, on the one hand, a desire on the part of the congregants
to have an uninterrupted silent <i>tefillah</i> in which they could give suitable expression each one to his personal and peculiar
wants and wishes. On the other hand, there was also a desire felt by many to be guided
in their devotions by the Reader. Our <i>minhag</i> satisfies both requirements. But it is a grave error to think, as unfortunately many
do, that, while the Reader repeats the <i>tefillah</i>, the congregants may turn their heart and mind to other things, however holy these
be. The congregation and the Reader must be united in devotion during <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה בצבור‎</span>, and where the continued concentration of thought during the <i>tefillah</i> and its repetition seems unattainable, it would be better to sacrifice the <i>minhag</i> of repeating the <i>tefillah</i> rather than to have the repetition of the prayer without the participation of the
congregants, or even without decorum.
</p>
<p>In the repetition of the <i>tefillah</i> the <i>kedushah</i> forms an important addition. The essential idea of the <i>kedushah</i> is repeated thrice during the Morning Service, viz., in the first of the benedictions
preceding the <i>shema</i>, in the <i>tefillah</i> or <i>Amidah</i>, and in the concluding section commencing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ובא לציון‎</span>.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.3">In the first <i>kedushah</i> (called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדושה דיוצר‎</span>), while praising God <span class="pageNum" id="pb448">[<a href="#pb448">448</a>]</span>as the Creator of light and of the heavenly luminaries, we introduce these, as proclaiming,
as it were, the holiness and glory of God in the words of the Prophets. In the last
<i>kedushah</i> (called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדושה דסידרא‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סידרא דקדושה‎</span>) we merely read, among other passages from the Prophets, those verses of Isaiah and
Ezekiel which contain the chief sentences of the <i>kedushah</i>. In the <i>kedushah</i> of the <i>tefillah</i> the Reader summons the congregation to proclaim the sanctification of God in the
manner of the angels above; it has therefore its place only in Public Worship, whilst
as to the other two <i>kedushoth</i> there is no difference whether a person prays by himself or in a congregation of
worshippers.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.4">As regards <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדיש וברכו‎</span>, two prayers generally united, it must be remarked that in their meaning they are
disunited: the half-<i>kaddish</i> is the conclusion of the <i>mizmorim</i> or <i>pesuke dezimrah</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכו‎</span> is the commencement of the next section: <i>shema</i>, with its benedictions. The half-<i>kaddish</i>, wherever it occurs, concludes some section of the Service. In <i>shacharith</i>, after <i>Amidah</i>, or after “Supplications,” or after the Reading of the Law; at <i>Musaf</i>, <i>Minchah</i>, <i>Neïlah</i>, and <i>Maaribh</i> after the introductory psalms. The half-<i>kaddish</i> before the <i>Amidah</i> in the <i>Maaribh</i> is probably a remnant of the whole <i>kaddish</i> that used to be said when the Service ended there and the <i>Amidah</i> was considered optional (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות‎</span>).
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.5">4. <i>On Page 442 (3).</i>
</p>
<p>An important element in the Service is religious instruction. The means adopted were
the reading of the Torah and Haphtarah, the introduction of moral lessons, principles
of faith, exposition of Divine precepts into the Service, and lectures containing
various lessons, exhortations, and explanations of the Biblical and Post-Biblical
Sacred Literature. These lectures are an ancient institution. The prophets instructed
the people, especially on New-moon and Sabbath (2 Kings iv. 23); the Scribes and the
Rabbis of the Talmudic age expounded the Torah and other Biblical and Post-Biblical
writings; they were followed by <i>darshanim</i> and <i>maggidim</i>, the modern preachers and ministers. The aim of these lectures is to create, maintain,
or intensify the fear of God and the love of the Torah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבת תורה ויראת שמים‎</span>).
</p>
<p>The Sermon has lost much of its original force and influence. The cause of this fact
is probably to be sought chiefly in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb449">[<a href="#pb449">449</a>]</span>materialism and scepticism of the age, but to some degree also in the character of
the sermon. It cannot be denied that the pulpit, instead of being made a place from
which Love of Torah and Fear of God receive life, encouragement, and strength, is
frequently turned into a platform for discussing communal or personal quarrels or
theological controversies, or creating a discontent with existing institutions, without
sufficiently considering the result of such discontent. Themes like these are not
outside the province of the preacher, but they must not be the staple of his discourses,
which must principally seek to foster <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבת תורה ויראת שמים‎</span> in the hearts of the congregants. As to the history and literature of this branch
of the Service, see Zunz, <i lang="de">Die Gottesdienstlichen Vorträge der Juden</i>. Berlin, 1832.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.6">5. <i>On Page 420.</i>
</p>
<p>The question is frequently asked whether special meetings and Services may be arranged
with a view of improving the religious status of the Jewish community. There is no
reason why attempts should not be made in this direction. By all means let everything
be done that is conducive to a revival of religious feeling and religious practice.
But in such attempts care must be taken that nothing be done that is contrary to the
precepts of the Law, both Written and Oral; that the teachers, preachers, or lecturers
do not themselves display a disregard for recognised religious authority, and by such
conduct undermine the existing reverence for the inherited traditional Religion.
</p>
<p>On this basis meetings on Sabbath for the purpose of reading the Bible, praying, and
singing, in whatever language this be done, and special Services for the pupils of
Religion Classes at the close of the session, must be welcome to all who have a love
for our holy Religion.
</p>
<p id="ch2.5.4.6.7">6. <i>On Page 420.</i>
</p>
<p>A question of equal importance that frequently disturbs the peace of the congregation
is this: whether and in how far the established Ritual or <i>minhag</i> of a Synagogue may be altered. The Ritual is not the work of one man or of one age;
it is the product of the thoughts and the feelings of our nation through many <span class="pageNum" id="pb450">[<a href="#pb450">450</a>]</span>centuries. Its foundation was laid by the Men of the Great Synagogue in the time of
Ezra. Generation after generation were busy in the construction of the building; storey
was added to storey; from time to time new wings made their appearance. Reverence
and piety made successive builders reluctant to pull down what the same feelings of
preceding generations had reared. The whole formed a Sanctuary every single stone
of which was cherished and guarded against desecration. Notwithstanding the storms
and tempests to which it was exposed, and which certainly caused a breach here and
there, our Sanctuary stands still on its ancient foundations, and its walls retain
their power of resistance.
</p>
<p>What is the duty of the present generation with regard to this structure? Architects
or would-be architects examine it minutely from foundation to top-stone; but they
come to different conclusions. We will examine these conclusions, <i lang="la">sine irâ et studio</i>, assuming that the examination has been conducted <i lang="la">bonâ fide</i>, with a view of strengthening the Sanctuary, and that the reports are in accordance
with truth and the examiners’ innermost conviction.
</p>
<p>(1.) Some declare “the Building no longer <i>attractive</i>; there are so many other edifices full of points of attraction both without and within;
these must in course of time draw away the visitors from our Sanctuary, and estrange
those who used to fill it.” We admit the force of the argument. It has always been
the aim of those who had the management of the Synagogue in their hands to make the
Service attractive; there is no reason why it could or should not be done at present.
Means of attraction are mostly of an external character: the art and luxury displayed
in the building and its furniture, the eloquence of the preacher, the voice of the
reader, the singing of the choir, introduction of novelties, such as instrumental
music (<i>scil.</i>, on week-days) and prayers in the vernacular. In themselves these things are harmless,
and although they are not the essence of the worship, they may lead to it;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13487src" href="#xd32e13487">135</a> and, for this reason, it must be considered a condition <i lang="la">sine quâ non</i>, that the style of singing, reading, and preaching should be such as to please the
majority, if not every one, of the congregants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13495src" href="#xd32e13495">136</a> But there is this to be feared and guarded <span class="pageNum" id="pb451">[<a href="#pb451">451</a>]</span>against: viz., that the husk be mistaken for the fruit, and true devotion be lost.
Besides, the experiment has been made, and the desired result has not been obtained.
There are plenty of places for the enjoyment of vocal and instrumental music, with
which the Synagogue would vie in vain in point of attractiveness, and novelties, as
novelties, soon wear away, and bring no real improvement. Let the leaders of the Synagogue
strengthen the faith of their brethren in God and His Word, maintain, by good example,
their reverence for our ancient traditions and customs, and be themselves earnest
and devout worshippers; they will then surely be more successful in drawing others
to the House of God.
</p>
<p>(2.) Another critic says: “The Synagogue Services are discordant;” that is, the feelings
expressed in our prayers have no echo in the hearts of the worshippers. “Education
and general progress have so entirely changed the whole life of man that he can no
longer be edified by the prayers and method of devotion followed by our forefathers.”
Those who assert this, of course, only assert it of themselves, and so far their statement
may be accepted as correct. But on examining it more closely we find that there must
be something misleading in it. For what is the central idea of the ancient prayers
and hymns? The conviction that we address our Heavenly Father, who is the Creator
and Ruler of the Universe; who is just, good, and holy; who alone can fulfil the wishes
which we utter in our prayers, and “who is near to all those who call upon him in
truth.” Does progress of education force us to abandon this principle? Certainly not.
Those who do abandon it cannot be said to do so by force of education, for they are
found among the educated and uneducated alike; and we should be false to our own Faith
if we were to abandon this fundamental principle of our Divine Service.
</p>
<p>The second of the fundamental Principles of our Faith, though less general than the
preceding, is yet equally essential in Judaism, viz., the belief in Revelation, in
the Integrity and the Divine origin of the Torah, and the truth of the Divine messages
sent through the prophets. The Ritual is replete with references to this belief, and
it would amount to a rejection of this essentially Jewish Principle, if we were to
expunge such references from the Ritual in order to please a few unbelievers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb452">[<a href="#pb452">452</a>]</span></p>
<p>References to the Sacrificial Service, and especially prayers for its restoration,
are disliked by some, who think such restoration undesirable. Let no one pray for
a thing against his will; let him whose heart is not with his fellow-worshippers in
any of their supplications silently substitute his own prayers for them, but let him
not interfere with the devotion of those to whom “the statutes of the Lord are right,
rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord pure, enlightening the eyes; the
judgments of the Lord true and righteous altogether” (Ps. xix. 9, 10), and who yearn
for the opportunity of fulfilling Divine commandments which they cannot observe at
present.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13510src" href="#xd32e13510">137</a> Prayer, in the true sense of the word, is impossible without the recognition of God
as our Master, whom we are willing to serve, and whose commands we desire to do, whether
the act implied in them be in other respects agreeable to us or not.
</p>
<p>(3.) The Ritual contains many sections which owe their existence to particular circumstances
that have passed away, and to local conditions which are different from those prevailing
in the countries in which we live. Have these a right to be kept perpetually in the
Ritual? Certainly not. There is no reason why prayers which have become obsolete and
meaningless should not be modified or discontinued. But as a rule our prayers are
free from references to the particular causes of their composition, and there is no
need to expunge from the Service petitions, thanksgivings, or praises which were originally
intended for a special occasion, if they are expressed in general terms, and have
become in the Synagogue a source of devotion and edification. But as to the latter
condition, it is difficult to decide whether a liturgical composition has become,
and is still, an aid to devotion. Much depends on the individual character of the
particular congregation in which the question has been raised, and each case should
be decided on its own merits by a competent and responsible authority.
</p>
<p>Many of the <i>Piyyutim</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13517src" href="#xd32e13517">138</a> and <i>Selichoth</i> belong to this class; also a few sections in the ordinary Ritual (see note 2), and
the repetition <span class="pageNum" id="pb453">[<a href="#pb453">453</a>]</span>of the <i>Amidah</i>, and the <i>Kiddush</i> in the Synagogue on the eve of Sabbaths and Festivals.
</p>
<p>(4.) It is further asserted that the Ritual was formulated in bygone times; our wants
and tastes are different from those of former ages. We can neither pray for the same
things nor in the same way as our ancestors. But what did our ancestors pray for?
For the well-being of their body and of their soul; for the realisation of our national
hopes and the ultimate triumph of our holy Religion. Just the same ends we wish to
obtain at present, and these objects form the substance of our Ritual.—There are some
petitions which seem to many out of place, and out of date. Such are petitions against
cruel oppressors. Our fathers had good reason to cry to the Almighty for relief, for
they were oppressed, whilst we, living in a free country, in the enjoyment of all
the rights of citizens, have no cause whatever for complaint. If we were to separate
ourselves from our brethren in distant countries, we could expunge all such petitions
from the Ritual. This is, however, not the case; we feel deeply grieved at the sufferings
of our brethren. We should like to see them relieved from oppression and persecution,
and pray to God for His interference in behalf of the persecuted. When we use the
term “revenge” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נקם‎</span>) we do not associate with it any base desire to see the enemy crushed or annihilated;
we use it rather in the sense of a just and merited penalty for evil-doers, and associate
with it the idea of the ultimate victory and triumph of our holy Religion after long
periods of oppression and persecution. It is their Faith for which our fathers suffered,
and our brethren in some countries still suffer, and the triumph of which forms the
centre of these petitions. Intense grief and sorrow sometimes suggested harsh expressions,
such as “Destroy our enemies,” “Put an end to them,” but these are figurative expressions,
and are used in the sense explained by Beruria, the wife of Rabbi Meir: “May the sinners
cease from sinning, and sinners will be no more.” Similarly we pray in the <i>Amidah</i>: “Let our slanderers have no hope of success, so that evil-doers may soon vanish
and disappear; break the power of the presumptuous, and humble them.” In these words
we give expression to our feeling of indignation against the slanderers of our holy
Religion, the revilers of Judaism, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as from time to time renew the blood-accusations, <span class="pageNum" id="pb454">[<a href="#pb454">454</a>]</span>or by false and deceptive arguments or other means entice Jews to abandon their faith.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13553src" href="#xd32e13553">139</a>
</p>
<p>(5.) We hear frequently the complaint that the Public Service is too long. This complaint
is of a relative character; it is different from the feeling of joy expressed in the
words, “Blessed are those who dwell in thy house;” it is different from the sentiment
of those <i>chasidim</i> (Mishnah, Berachoth v. 1) who sat still a while before the commencement of the prescribed
prayer, or those who after the conclusion thereof sit down again, saying, “Surely
the righteous shall give thanks to thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence”
(Ps. cxl. 14). As regards the length of the Service, we should bear in mind the principle
of our Sages: It makes no difference whether the Service is long or short: only be
devout. It is provocative of irreverence to protract the Service unnecessarily until
it becomes wearisome; but it is equally unbecoming to hurry over it as though it were
an unpleasant task. On the whole the Services, especially when they are well regulated,
are not too long, unless too much time be spent in singing or in unnecessary interruptions.
</p>
<p>In all cases in which a modification seems advisable and lawful it must be borne in
mind that the Ritual is a Sanctuary every element of which is holy, and that hasty
reforms may be less effective than is hoped. It may perhaps be easy to pull down,
but it is not so easy to build up. Devout members of a congregation may easily be
alienated, but not so easily will new members be attracted, or if attracted, permanently
retained.

<p>Rabban Gamaliel said, “Provide thyself a teacher, and be quit of doubt” (Aboth i.
16). The rule laid down in these words for every individual applies also to the whole
community. Questions like those mentioned in the preceding note frequently arise in
Jewish congregations, and cause dissension where union is so much needed. A teacher
must be appointed in every community, <span class="pageNum" id="pb455">[<a href="#pb455">455</a>]</span>who shall be able to guide and to instruct it as to what is right and wrong. In fact,
such a teacher has, as a rule, been appointed in Jewish congregations; he is known
by various names: Haham (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכם‎</span>), Rav (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רב‎</span> “Teacher”), Rabbi (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רבי‎</span> “My teacher”), Teacher of righteousness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מורה צדק‎</span>), and Judge (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דין‎</span>). The weight of his authority is less to be determined by the nature of his office
or by written conditions than by his learning, piety, and personal influence. According
to the rule, “Judge not alone” (<i>ibid.</i> iv. 8), he is generally assisted by two councillors (<i>dayganim</i>), with whom he forms a court of judgment—<i>Beth-din</i>—when questions of more than ordinary importance have to be decided. The congregation
must accept his decisions as final, and must have confidence that he, like the high-priest
of old, will give his answers according to “light and integrity.”

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">VI.</span> <span class="sc">The Dietary Laws.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing” (Deut. xiv. 3); that is, according to our
traditional explanation, everything that the Word of God declares to be abominable
(Sifre, <i>ad locum</i>). One of the sections of the Dietary Laws concludes thus: “For I am the Lord that
brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy,
for I am holy” (Lev. xi. 45).
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1">Holiness is therefore the only object of these laws that is distinctly mentioned in
the Pentateuch. But what is the nature of the holiness which they are intended to
produce or to promote? “The Dietary Laws,” says Maimonides, “train us in the mastery
over our appetites; they accustom us to restrain the growth of desire, the indulgence
in seeking that which is pleasant, and the disposition to consider the pleasure of
eating and drinking the end of man’s existence” (“The Guide,” III., chap. xxv. p.
167). And, indeed, <span class="pageNum" id="pb456">[<a href="#pb456">456</a>]</span>wherever the Law commands restraint of some bodily enjoyment, or restriction of any
of our appetites, such commandment is followed or preceded by the exhortation to be
holy, or the warning not to defile oneself.
</p>
<p>Is there any secondary object in these laws besides the motive distinctly mentioned?
It has frequently been observed that Jews have enjoyed a certain degree of immunity
from epidemics that raged among their non-Jewish neighbours. It has further been noticed
that they have a lower rate of mortality and a greater longevity. These facts are
generally explained to be the result of a temperate life, regulated by the Divine
Law. Finding that such is the consequence of obedience to the Dietary Laws, we may
fairly assume that in distinguishing certain things from the rest, in prohibiting
some and permitting others, the Lawgiver aimed at the health and the well-being of
man’s body. Our conception of the goodness of God compels us to believe that in recommending
certain things for our use He intended thereby to promote our well-being, and to show
us what is good for our health, and what is injurious. But we must take care that
we do not on that account consider these precepts exclusively as sanitary regulations,
however important such regulations may be. We must not lose sight of the fact that
Holiness is the only object of the Dietary Laws, mentioned in the Pentateuch.
</p>
<p>But what difference can it make to the Almighty whether we eat this or that? Surely
it makes no difference to the Almighty; but we have faith in His Goodness and Wisdom,
and are convinced that He knows by what means we may best attain to that <span class="pageNum" id="pb457">[<a href="#pb457">457</a>]</span>holiness which we are so frequently exhorted to seek, and that the Divine Laws which
He revealed to us for this very purpose show the shortest and the safest road to this
aim.
</p>
<p>With the following exceptions, the Dietary Laws concern only animal food:—
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.1">(1.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערלה‎</span> “Forbidden fruit,” <i>i.e.</i>, the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting (Lev. xix. 23).—The
fruit of the fourth year (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נטע רבעי‎</span>) was formerly, in the time of the Temple, brought to Jerusalem, and consumed there
amidst praises and thanksgiving to Him who is the source of all blessing (<i>ibid.</i> v. 24). Those who lived far from Jerusalem were allowed to redeem the fruit of the
fourth year with silver, and to spend the latter in the holy city.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.2">(2.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חדש‎</span> “New corn.”—The Omer of barley offered on the second day of Passover is called “the
first of your harvest” (Lev. xxiii. 10), and it was enjoined, “Ye shall eat neither
bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13629src" href="#xd32e13629">140</a> until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God” (<i>ibid.</i> 14).
</p>
<p>These two laws (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערלה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חדש‎</span>) seem to have their source in the dictum, “The first of the first-fruits of thy ground
thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God” (Exod. xxiii. 19).
</p>
<p>(3.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כלאים‎</span>.—Mixture of different kinds. “Thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed”
(Lev. xix. 19).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13651src" href="#xd32e13651">141</a> “Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with <span class="pageNum" id="pb458">[<a href="#pb458">458</a>]</span>two kinds of seed” (Deut. xxii. 9). In the former case only the sowing of divers kinds
is prohibited, but the produce of such sowing is not forbidden; in the latter case,
if the law is transgressed, the produce of both the vine and the seed is not to be
used for any purpose whatever (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסור בהנאה‎</span>), for the law is followed by the words, “lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed
which thou hast sown and the increase of the vineyard.”
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.3">Although these and similar<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13661src" href="#xd32e13661">142</a> precepts are introduced by the words “Ye shall keep my statutes (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חקתי‎</span>),” and no reason is given for the enactment of these statutes, it seems, from the
position occupied by these laws in a section of moral precepts, that they serve as
reminders of the important lesson that our conduct should be regulated by the principles
of contentment and simplicity of life, principles which are the best safeguard against
undue desire for luxury and superfluity. The prohibition of sowing divers kinds of
seed further reminds us of the importance of preserving our heart in a state of simplicity
and purity; that twofold weights, twofold measures, and especially a twofold heart
are an abomination to the Lord.
</p>
<p>In reference to animal food the following principles are observed:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb459">[<a href="#pb459">459</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.4">1. The killing of animals and the consuming of their flesh must not tend to create
savage and cruel habits. It is therefore forbidden—
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) To cut off a piece of flesh from a living animal for our food (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבר מן החי‎</span> “a limb of a living animal”).
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) To kill the parent with its young on the same day (Lev. xxii. 28; comp. Deut. xxii.
6).
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) To give unnecessary pain to the animal in killing it. The various regulations for
the lawful killing of animals, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שחיטה‎</span>, handed down by Tradition as Mosaic, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלכה למשה מסיני‎</span>, are not only in harmony with this principle, but seem in many instances to have
been dictated by it.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.5">(<i>d.</i>) To eat the blood of beasts and birds (Lev. xvii. 12, 14). The blood contained in
the meat is removed as far as possible by having the meat soaked in water for half-an-hour,
and then kept covered with salt for an hour, the salt being again removed by rinsing.
This process is called <i>kasher</i>; that is, preparing the meat so as to make it <i>kasher</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כשר‎</span> “fit for food”).
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.6">2. The flesh of beasts and birds that have died from any other cause than having been
killed in the manner prescribed is forbidden. The flesh of animals that have been
killed in the prescribed manner, but are found to have been affected with some dangerous
disease, is also forbidden as <i>t’refah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טרפה‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13721src" href="#xd32e13721">143</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.7">3. With regard to the distinction between animals allowed for food and those forbidden,
all animals are <span class="pageNum" id="pb460">[<a href="#pb460">460</a>]</span>divided into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהמה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה‎</span> “cattle and beast,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וף‎</span> “bird,” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דג‎</span> “fish,” and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שרץ‎</span> “creeping thing.”
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) With regard to cattle and beasts, the rule is given, “Whosoever parteth the hoof
and is cloven-footed and cheweth the cud, that you may eat” (Lev. xi. 3).—The clean
cattle (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהמה טהורה‎</span>) and the clean beasts (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה טהורה‎</span>) are enumerated in Deut. xiv. 4 and 5 respectively.
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) A number of <i>birds</i> are enumerated (Lev. xi. 13–19) as forbidden, but no general characteristics of the
clean or the unclean birds are given; and as we are uncertain as to the exact meaning
of the names of many of the birds, we only use for food such birds as are traditionally
known as “clean birds.”
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) <i>Fish</i> that have scales and fins are permitted; others—<i>e.g.</i>, the eel—are “unclean” (<i>ibid.</i> xi. 9–12).
</p>
<p>(<i>d.</i>) “All winged animals that creep (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שרץ העוף‎</span>), going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you. Yet these may ye eat of,
every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their
feet, to leap withal upon the earth; even these of them ye may eat; the <i>arbeh</i> with its kind, and the <i>soleam</i> with its kind, the <i>chargol</i> with its kind, and the <i>chagabh</i> with its kind” (<i>ibid.</i> 20–22). These are certain kinds of locusts that satisfy the above condition. (Comp.
Maimonides, Mishneh-torah, <i>Hilchoth maachaloth asuroth</i> i. 21–23.)
</p>
<p>(<i>e.</i>) “And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination;
it shall not be eaten” (Lev. xi. 41). In this prohibition are included all kinds of
worms such as are found in fruit, and mites, snails, oysters, lobsters, crabs, &amp;c.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb461">[<a href="#pb461">461</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. The milk of “unclean” cattle or beasts (<i>e.g.</i>, asses’ milk), the eggs of “unclean” birds, and the roe of “unclean” fish (<i>e.g.</i>, caviare prepared of the roe of the sturgeon) are likewise forbidden.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.8">5. “Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat” (Lev. vii. 23).
From the context we learn that only those portions of the fat of cattle are forbidden
which in the case of sacrifices were burnt upon the altar as an offering made by fire
unto the Lord,<span id="xd32e13811"></span> viz., “the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
and the fat that is upon the kidneys which is by the flanks” (<i>ibid.</i> iii. 3, 4). The forbidden fat is known by the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חלב‎</span>, <i>chelebh</i>, whilst the fat permitted as food is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שומן‎</span>, <i>shuman</i>.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.9">6. “Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew which shrank, which is
upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s
thigh in the sinew that shrank” (Gen. xxxii. 33). This law is designed to remind us
of the wrestling of Jacob with the man who attacked him, which struggle forms a type
of Israel’s fight against the evil threatening him from within and from without, and
teaches us the lesson that, despite temporary troubles and struggles, Israel will
ultimately be victorious. The hind-quarters of cattle are not eaten unless the forbidden
fat and “the sinew that shrank” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גיד הנשה‎</span>) have first been removed from them.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.10">7. “Thou shalt not seethe the kid in its mother’s milk” (Exod. xxiii. 19). Tradition
explains this law as forbidding all mixture of meat and milk (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בשר בחלב‎</span>). In its literal sense the verse in which this law is <span class="pageNum" id="pb462">[<a href="#pb462">462</a>]</span>mentioned seems to point to the duty of self-restraint, as if to tell us that we should
not greedily devour the first ripe fruit, or the young immediately after their birth.
</p>
<p>The significance of the law may be learnt from the fact that it is mentioned three
times in the Pentateuch. Hence the strictness with which this commandment is observed
in Jewish homes. In a Jewish household, established in accordance with Jewish law
and tradition, there are two separate sets of utensils, the one to be used for the
preparation of meat-diet, the other for the preparation of milk and butter diet.
</p>
<p>The flesh of fish is not considered as meat in this respect, nor are fish subject
to the laws of <i>shechitah</i>.

</p>
<p>The prohibition of eating meat taken from the body of an animal whilst alive is based
on the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אך בשר בנפשו דמו לא תאכלו‎</span> “But flesh, when the blood thereof is in its soul, shall ye not eat” (Gen. ix. 4).
The phrase “to be in the soul” means to be surrounded and animated by the soul, to
be in the midst of active, living organs of the animal. “The blood of an animal is
in the soul thereof” may therefore be paraphrased thus, “The blood hath its vital
powers and the animal is alive.” (Comp. Lev. xvii. 11.)
</p>
<p>This prohibition is one of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע מצות בני נח‎</span> “the seven Noachide commandments,” <i>i.e.</i>, commandments which, according to Tradition, were already in force in the days of
Noah, and are binding on all his children or all mankind, and not on the Israelites
alone; viz., (1) the prohibition of idolatry (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבודה זרה‎</span>), (2) of murder (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפיכות דם‎</span>), (3) of adultery (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גלוי עריות‎</span>), (4) of blasphemy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת השם‎</span>), (5) of robbery (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גזל‎</span>), (6) of eating meat taken from a living animal (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבר מן החי‎</span>), and (7) the institution of courts of justice (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דינין‎</span>). See Babyl. Talm., Sanhedrin 56<i>a</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb463">[<a href="#pb463">463</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.11.1">2. <i>On Page 459—1c.</i>
</p>
<p>The existence of certain rules concerning killing animals for food included in the
oral teaching of the Torah is derived from the following passage: “Thou shalt kill
of thy herd and of thy flock which the Lord hath given thee as I have commanded thee”
(Deut. xii. 21). In the Commentary of Rashi, <i>ad locum</i>, we read: “Here we see that certain commandments have been given with regard to the
killing of animals, how this should be done. These commandments are comprised in <i>Hilchoth Shechitah</i>, which form part of the Oral Law, revealed to Moses on Sinai.” They are fully discussed
and explained in the first chapter of the treatise <i>Chullin</i>.
</p>
<p>Any deviation from these rules in the act of killing the animal renders the <i>shechitah</i> unlawful (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסולה‎</span>). The killing of cattle, beasts, or fowl for food is therefore entrusted only to
such persons as possess a knowledge of the rules of <i>shechitah</i> and are skilled and trustworthy. The <i>beth-din</i> or the Chief-Rabbi decides whether a person has duly qualified himself for the office
of <i>shochet</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שוחט‎</span>), and whether he may kill animals for <i>kasher</i> food.
</p>
<p>It is the duty of the <i>shochet</i> to examine the animal before killing it, and to satisfy himself that it is not in
a dying condition; after the <i>shechitah</i> of any cattle or beast (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהמה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה‎</span>) he must examine the lungs to assure himself that they are in a normal condition.
If he finds them in a diseased state he declares the flesh of the animal as <i>t’refah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טרפה‎</span>) and unfit for food. In the case of poultry the examination is not made by the <i>shochet</i>; but if any deviation from the normal state is discovered in the lungs or in any
other part, the meat must not be used as food unless the animal has been examined
by a competent person (Rabbi or <i>dayyan</i>), and declared by him to be <i>kasher</i>.
</p>
<p>As to the beneficial influence of these examinations on the general condition of health
in the Jewish community, see Dr. H. Behrend’s articles in <i>Jewish Chronicle</i>, November 12, 1880, and October 24, 1890, and <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, October 1890.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.11.2">3. <i>On Page 459—1d.</i>
</p>
<p>The following particular rules are to be observed in <i>kashering</i> meat:—
</p>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) The meat is first soaked in water for half-an-hour; this <span class="pageNum" id="pb464">[<a href="#pb464">464</a>]</span>must be done within three days after the killing of the animal. It is then taken out
of the water, placed on a slanting board or in a wicker-basket, and after a few minutes,
when the water has sufficiently run off, sprinkled on all sides with salt. After the
lapse of an hour the salt is again removed by soaking and rinsing.
</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) In case of urgency, when, <i>e.g.</i>, the meat is wanted for a patient, or when on Friday afternoon there would not be
left time enough for cooking or roasting the meat, it need only be kept in water for
fifteen minutes and in salt for half-an-hour.
</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) In <i>kashering</i> poultry all the inner parts of the animal must be taken out and salted separately;
the rest must be sprinkled with salt both within and without.
</p>
<p>(<i>d.</i>) Liver is salted a little and roasted on fire, not in the oven or in any vessel.
This done, the liver may be cooked or roasted in any way.
</p>
<p>(<i>e.</i>) The heart is cut open before the salting, and a piece is cut off at the apex, in
order that the blood may run off more easily.—For the same purpose the horny part
of the legs is cut off.—The head must be opened and sprinkled with salt on both sides,
after the brain has been taken out; from the latter the skin is drawn off, and then
it is salted.
</p>
<p>(<i>f.</i>) Eggs found in poultry are treated as meat, but must be salted separately.
</p>
<p>(<i>g.</i>) The vessels used for soaking and salting the meat should not be used for other purposes.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.11.3">4. <i>On Page 459—1c.</i>
</p>
<p>The law of <i>shechitah</i> applies only to cattle, beasts, and birds (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהמה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוף‎</span>); there is no commandment as regards the killing of fish. Tradition supports this
exception by reference to the distinction made in Num. xi. 22: “Shall the flocks and
the herds be slain (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ישחט‎</span>) for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יאסף‎</span>) for them, to suffice them?” Although the latter term (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יאסף‎</span>) is also used of quails (<i>ibid.</i> 32), no such inference is made with regard to birds, because in ver. 32 the term
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יאסף‎</span> is not contrasted by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ישחט‎</span>; besides, the verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שחט‎</span> is frequently applied in the Law to birds, but never to fish. Comp. Babyl. Talm.,
Chullin, p. 27<i>b</i>.
</p>
<p>There is this difference to be observed between <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהמה‎</span> on the <span class="pageNum" id="pb465">[<a href="#pb465">465</a>]</span>one hand, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוף‎</span> on the other. In the case of the latter two the <i>shechitah</i> must be followed by the covering of the blood (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כסוי דם‎</span> Lev. xvii. 13). The object of this law is, according to some, to prevent the blood
being used for idolatrous and superstitious purposes, as birds and beasts were generally
hunted in the fields, mountains, and woods, places frequently associated in the imagination
of the ancients with evil spirits and the like. (Comp. Commentary of R. Obadiah Seforno
on the Pentateuch, <i lang="la">ad locum</i>.) The law was perhaps intended to impress the lesson on the mind of the hunter that
the blood shed of a living being presents a ghastly sight that offends the eye of
man. He will accustom himself to think that taking away the life of another being,
even of an animal, is an act of grave responsibility, and will not be led to misuse
his weapons against any of his fellow-men.
</p>
<p id="ch2.6.1.11.4">5. <i>On Page 460—3b.</i>
</p>
<p>Comp. Mishnah, Treatise Chullin, iii. 6.—The characteristics of the clean and the
unclean cattle and beasts are given in the Pentateuch, but the characteristics of
the clean or the unclean birds are not mentioned in the Law. Our Sages, however, declared
every bird of prey—or every bird that seizes its food with its claws, and lifts it
up from the ground before eating it (Rashi) to be an unclean bird; while all birds
are clean that have a projecting claw (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אצבע יתרה‎</span> a claw longer than the rest) and a crop (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זפק‎</span>), and whose stomach has a membrane that can easily be peeled off (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קרקבנו נקלף‎</span>). Another rule is this: Birds that dwell and associate with unclean birds are unclean.
“Not without reason does the starling go to the raven: they are of the same species”
(Babyl. Talm., Chullin 65<i>b</i>). The sentence serves also as a moral lesson (<i>ibid.</i>, Baba Kama 92<i>a</i>). At present, however, only those birds are killed for food which are known traditionally
to have always been considered as “clean birds” (Maimonides, Mishneh-torah, <i>Hilchoth maachaloth <span class="corr" id="xd32e14080" title="Source: asur th">asuroth</span></i>, i. 14–20; Tur Joredeah, chap. lxxxii.).

</p>
<p>Onkelos translates this commandment: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא תיכול בשר בחלב‎</span> “Thou shalt not eat meat in milk,” in accordance with the Oral Law. The threefold
repetition of the commandment forbidding <span class="pageNum" id="pb466">[<a href="#pb466">466</a>]</span>the seething of a kid in its mother’s milk is explained traditionally to indicate
a threefold prohibition: that of boiling meat and milk together, that of eating such
mixture, and that of deriving any benefit whatever from it (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ואיסור‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איסור אכילה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איסור בישול הנאה‎</span>). In obedience to the principle, “Make a fence round the Law,” we abstain from milk
or butter for some time after having partaken of meat.

<p id="ch2.6.1.11.6">7. <i>On Page 461—4.</i>

<p>The honey of bees is an apparent exception from the rule that the products of the
unclean animals are forbidden. The honey mentioned in the Bible is mostly the juice
of fruit, especially of dates; but the honey of bees is also mentioned (Judges xiv.
8). It is assumed that honey does not contain any part of the bee itself, but is merely
the juice of the flowers sucked and again discharged by the bees. (See Babyl. Talm.,
Bechoroth 7<i>b</i>; Maim., Mishneh-torah, <i>Hil. maachaloth asuroth</i> iii. 3.)

</p>
<p>In addition to the things enumerated in this chapter as forbidden, there is the prohibition
of “wine of libation” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יין נסך‎</span>). Everything used in the worship of idols was condemned, and could not serve as food,
drink, or any purpose; it was <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסור בהנאה‎</span>. Wine was frequently used by heathens in libations to their idols. The wine of a
heathen was therefore always suspected of having been employed in idolatrous libations,
and was consequently forbidden as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יין נסך‎</span>. Since, however, such libations have ceased this prohibition has also lapsed.
</p>
<p>It has, however, not lapsed in its entirety. It is only the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסור הנאה‎</span> that is no longer in force. The prohibition of using wine prepared by non-Jews (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סתם יין‎</span>) as a beverage still continues. This and similar prohibitions were intended as a
barrier against the increase of mixed marriages among the Jews. (Comp. Babyl. Talm.,
Shabbath 17<i>b</i>.)

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="ch2.7.1" class="first">The first paragraph of the <i>Shulchan-aruch</i> runs thus: “ ‘I have set the Lord always before me’ is one of the most important
principles of our holy Religion;” and, indeed, the more the actions of the Jew conform
to this principle, the nearer does he approach the ideal of a true servant of God,
who is faithful in the service of his Master, and whose life is the expression of
genuine recognition of God’s sovereignty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת עול מלכות שמים‎</span>) with unconditional obedience to His Will (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלת עול מצות‎</span>). Neither attendance at Public Service, nor the regular recitation of prayers, nor
the study of the Law, nor the performance of certain religious acts, constitute by
themselves Jewish Life, but the supreme influence which the Word of God—the Torah—is
constantly made to exercise over man’s doings. Every movement of his is regulated
by the Law, and wherever he turns he is met by a Divine precept that elevates his
heart towards Him who gave us the Law. The very garments he wears, though not different
from those of his fellow-men,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14156src" href="#xd32e14156">144</a> except by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb468a">[<a href="#pb468a">468</a>]</span>absence of <i>shaatnez</i> (combination of wool and linen), include the <i>arba kanfoth</i>, “the four-cornered garment,” with <i>tsitsith</i>; his house, the same in every other respect as those of his neighbours, is distinguished
by the <i>mezuzah</i> on the doorposts. These distinctive characteristics, however, are not intended to
attract the attention of others; they only concern the man himself; they serve him
as reminders of God and His Will. Within the house the furniture and the whole arrangement
are in accordance with the custom and fashion of the place;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14176src" href="#xd32e14176">145</a> there is simplicity or luxury, taste or want of taste, according to the individual
character of the occupier. Only the kitchen and the table have a distinctly Jewish
aspect; these must be adapted to the requirements of the Dietary Laws. The most striking
feature is the double set of kitchen utensils and of vessels for the table, the one
set for meat, the other for butter and milk.
</p>
<p>In the choice of his occupation, trade, or profession, the Jew, like all his fellow-men,
is influenced by his <span class="pageNum" id="pb469">[<a href="#pb469">469</a>]</span>inclination, capabilities, and opportunities; but, in addition to these, there is
another important factor that must ultimately determine the choice—his religion; and
such occupation as would be likely to compel him to abandon any of the Divine precepts,
cannot be chosen. No manner of labour or trade is in itself derogatory; on the contrary,
all labour is honourable, unless man degrades it by his conduct, and by the object
he aims at achieving by means of it. Thrift, economy, and temperance are essential
conditions of success. But success, however desirable, and however sweet when obtained,
leads only to the material well-being of man. As to his spiritual well-being, the
Jew, though busy with urgent work, will try to find some spare moments in which to
turn his attention to “the three things upon which the world is based: Study of the
Torah, Divine Service, and Charity” (Aboth i. 2).
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.2">Before the work of the day commences, and when it is finished, attention is paid to
<i>torah</i> and <i>abhodah</i>. The Service, especially the Morning Service, contains various sections which are
not prayers, but rather lessons for study. In addition to these, the Jew, according
to his capacity or opportunity, should read the Bible, the Mishnah, and the Talmud.
For those who have no opportunity at home, the <i>Beth ha-midrash</i> is open with its library. Synagogue and <i>Beth ha-midrash</i> are the places of spiritual recreation where the Jew refreshes his mind, elevates
his heart, and gathers new strength, courage, and hope for the battle of life.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.3">Charity in its various branches, <i>tsedakah</i> and <i>gemiluth chasadim</i>, is a virtue practised by the wealthy and the poor alike. Any heart or house from
which this <span class="pageNum" id="pb470">[<a href="#pb470">470</a>]</span>virtue is absent does not deserve to be called Jewish. Some Jews have charity-boxes
in their houses, and whenever any member of the family has something to spare or is
moved by a special impulse of charity, these boxes receive an addition to their contents.
Others imitate the law of <i>maaser</i> (“tithe”), and set aside a tenth part of their earnings and profits for charitable
purposes. Hospitality (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הכנסת אורחים‎</span>) is another method of charity, and it forms one of the ornaments of a true Jewish
house. Although societies and public institutions do at present what was formerly
considered to be the duty of the members of the community, individual hospitality
has by no means become superfluous, and there is ample opportunity for its practice.
Hospitality graces especially the lady of the house; it is her duty to provide for
the comfort of the guests, and to act according to the rule, “Let the poor be the
children of thy house” (Aboth i. 5).
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.4">This is one of the privileges possessed by women. According to the principle of division
of labour, woman rules supreme in the house: “The King’s daughter is all glorious
within” (Ps. xlv. 14); whilst man is more in contact with the outer world, devotes
himself to labour, trade, or profession in order to provide the necessities of life
for those who are dependent upon him. There are, however, many exceptions to the rule,
and there is scarcely any trade or profession in which women have not been engaged.
Women were not excluded even from the highest honours. The Jews had their prophetesses,
and women were entrusted with judgeship and even with sovereignty. There are instances
of women distinguished by learning, experience, <span class="pageNum" id="pb471">[<a href="#pb471">471</a>]</span>wit, and especially by piety. Women of piety (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשים צדקניות‎</span>) were never wanting in Israel; and many a scholar owes the success he has attained
in the field of learning to the piety of his wife, who willingly undertook her husband’s
burdens and cares in trade and business in order to facilitate his devotion to study.
No sacrifice is too great for a true Jewish mother to have her children instructed
in the Word of God, and nothing adds more to the happiness and pride of the mother
than the progress her son has made in the knowledge of the Torah. “What is the great
merit of women? They have the merit of making their children attend the school, and
of encouraging their husbands to study the Talmud” (Babyl. Talm., Berachoth 17<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>The moral and the intellectual as well as the physical training of the children is
in its earliest stages almost exclusively in the hands of the mother. If we add to
this the responsibility for having the food prepared according to the requirements
of the Dietary Laws, we easily understand the reason why Jewish women are exempt from
various religious duties incumbent on the other sex. The rule is this: “Women are
exempt from the fulfilment of all precepts which are restricted to a certain time”
(Mishnah, Kiddushin i. 7), in order to prevent any collision between these and her
principal and most important duties in the house. Thus it happens that there are Jewish
women who faithfully cling to the inherited religion, and yet are rare visitors of
the Synagogue. On week-days the Synagogue is only in exceptional cases attended by
women.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb472">[<a href="#pb472">472</a>]</span></p>
<p>From this reason women are disqualified for forming the quorum (<i>minyan</i>) required for public worship (<i>tefillah batsibbur</i>). This and similar disqualifications are based on the principle of regard for women
and their home-duties, and by no means on a belief in their inferiority. Passages
in the Talmudical and Midrashic Literature which ascribe to women vanity, levity,
and other shortcomings are outweighed by sayings which evidence a sense of high regard
for the virtues and accomplishments of women. The following sentences are a few examples;
“Woman has been endowed by the Creator with greater intelligence than man” (Babyl.
Talm., Niddah 45<i>b</i>). “Who is rich? He who possesses a wife fair in her doings” (<i>ibid.</i>, Shabbath 25<i>b</i>). “It was through the merit of pious women that the Israelites were redeemed from
Egypt” (<i>ibid.</i>, Sotah 11<i>b</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14235src" href="#xd32e14235">146</a> Modesty and reservedness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צניעות‎</span>) are the distinguishing virtues of Jewish women. The principle, “The daughter of
the King is all glorious within,” was applied literally. In the fulfilment of her
home-duties the daughter of Israel seeks her <span class="pageNum" id="pb473">[<a href="#pb473">473</a>]</span>happiness and her pride. It used to be opposed to the sense of propriety of Jewish
ladies to speak, sing, or act in public.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14243src" href="#xd32e14243">147</a> This <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צניעות‎</span> was the main cause of the preservation of the sanctity of the Jewish home and the
purity of Jewish family life, a treasure and a blessing which ought to be well guarded.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.5">The working days of the week are divided between labour and devotion. Three Services
are attended daily either in the Synagogue or at home, and every meal is preceded
and followed by prayer. Jewish women have, in addition to the Prayer-book, a small
volume of supplications (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תחנות‎</span>) in the vernacular for every day, every season, and every occasion.
</p>
<p>Mondays and Thursdays, on which days a Lesson from the Law is read during the Morning
Service, are considered as special days for earnest devotion. There have been pious
Jews who fasted the whole or part of these days.—Tuesday is looked upon as a favoured
day, because it is distinguished in the account of the Creation (Gen. i. 10, 12) by
a repetition of the phrase, “And God saw that it was good.” It is therefore called
“the day with double <i>ki-tobh</i> (that it was good).” This circumstance may be the cause of the belief that it is
not advisable to begin a new undertaking on Monday or Wednesday;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14261src" href="#xd32e14261">148</a> preference should be <span class="pageNum" id="pb474a">[<a href="#pb474a">474</a>]</span>given to Tuesday. But this belief, although seemingly founded on a Biblical phrase,
is contrary to Jewish principles, and is included in the prohibition, “Ye shall not
observe times” (Lev. xix. 26), to declare a particular day as lucky or unlucky.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.6">Friday is an important and busy day in a Jewish house. It is not only the circumstance
that food is being prepared for two days<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14272src" href="#xd32e14272">149</a> that causes greater activity, but also the anticipated pleasure at the approach of
a beloved guest. The same is the case when a Festival is near. Each Festival has its
own particular wants and pleasures. In some houses the activity in preparing for Passover
may be noticed a whole month before, although the actual clearing of the <i>chamets</i> is done in a very short time. Before <i>Succoth</i> all hands are busy with preparing and ornamenting the Tabernacle, and selecting <i>esrog</i> and <i>lulabh</i>. It is genuine religious enthusiasm<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14290src" href="#xd32e14290">150</a> in the fulfilment of Divine duties that inspires this kind of activity, and gives
to the house a peculiarly Jewish tone and Jewish atmosphere. We feel in it “the season
of our joy” before and during the Three Festivals, and “the season of solemnity and
earnest reflection” during the penitential days; grief when the 9th of <i>Ab</i> approaches, <span class="pageNum" id="pb475">[<a href="#pb475">475</a>]</span>and hilarity when <i>Purim</i> is near. Twice a year we are invited by law and custom to give ourselves up to gladness
and merriment: on <i>Simchath-torah</i> and on <i>Purim</i>. Although even a certain excess of mirth is considered lawful on the latter occasion,
there are but very few that indulge in this license.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.7">All the seasons of rejoicing are also occasions for <i>mitsvoth</i>—charity, and for strengthening the bond of love between husband and wife, between
parents and children, and the bond of friendship between man and man. Every <i>erebh shabbath</i> and <i>erebh yom-tobh</i> afford the opportunity of giving <i>challah</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14319src" href="#xd32e14319">151</a> kindling Sabbath or Festival lights,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14323src" href="#xd32e14323">152</a> and inviting strangers<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14327src" href="#xd32e14327">153</a> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הכנסת אורחים‎</span>) to our meals. On Sabbaths and Festivals children, even when grown up, come to their
parents and ask for their blessing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14342src" href="#xd32e14342">154</a> Before <i>Kiddush</i> the husband chants the section of Prov. xxxi. beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשת חיל‎</span>, in praise of a good wife. The <i>Shabbath shalom</i> or Good <i>shabbath</i>, <i>Shabhua tobh</i> or Good <i>woch</i>, Good <i>yom tobh</i>, and similar salutations, remind us that we ought to have only good wishes for each
other. Sabbath and Festivals afford suitable occasions for home-devotion, in which
all the members of the family, males and females, should take part. The meals are
preceded and followed by the usual <i>berachoth</i>, but it <span class="pageNum" id="pb476">[<a href="#pb476">476</a>]</span>is customary to add extra psalms and hymns (<i>zemiroth</i>) in honour of the day, and those who are gifted should add to these, or even substitute
for them, compositions of their own in any language they like <i>in gloriam Dei</i>. A second kind of home-devotion which ought not to be neglected, but should rather
be revived where it is neglected, is the reading of the Scriptures. On Friday evening
the pious Jew reads the <i>Sidra</i> twice in the original and once in the <i>Targum</i>; but all should at least read <i>Sidra</i> and <i>Haphtarah</i> in the vernacular.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.8">The moon by its gradual increase in light from its minimum to full-moon, and the subsequent
decrease from full-moon to its minimum, has in Agadic and Midrashic Literature frequently
served as a symbol of the history of Israel, of his rise and his fall. The last day
of the decline, the eve of New-moon, is kept by some as a special day of prayer and
fasting,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14381src" href="#xd32e14381">155</a> while the first day of the rise, New-moon, is distinguished by <i>Hallel</i> and <i>Musaph</i>. If people, as a symbol of happiness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סימן טוב‎</span>), prefer the middle of the month for marriage, their choice is harmless; but if they
hold that season as more lucky than the rest of the month, they are guilty of superstition.
As at the sight of other natural phenomena, so also has a benediction been fixed on
observing the reappearance of the moon in the beginning of the month. For the above-mentioned
reason, importance is attached to this <i>berachah</i>, and prayers are added for the redemption of Israel. The <i>berachah</i>, which is generally recited in the open air, is the chief element in the ceremony;
the additional prayers and reflections are non-essential.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb477">[<a href="#pb477">477</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.7.9">In the foregoing, Jewish Life has been described as it appears at the various seasons
of the year; in the following, it will be given as it appears at the various periods
of man’s existence.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.1">The first important moment is, of course, the moment of birth. The father, friends,
and relatives are filled with anxiety for the life of both mother and child. Prayers
are daily offered up for the safety and recovery of the patient and the well-being
of the child. The Twentieth Psalm is sometimes written on a tablet placed in the room
where the confinement takes place, probably as a reminder or an invitation for visitors
to pray to the Almighty; in this sense the custom is to be commended; but if the tablet
is filled with meaningless signs, letters, and words, and is used merely as a charm,
the custom should be discontinued, being a superstitious practice. In some parts it
has been the custom that during the week preceding the <i>Berith-milah</i> friends visited the house to pray there for the well-being of the child, and boys
recited there Biblical passages containing blessings, such as Gen. xlviii. 16.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14406src" href="#xd32e14406">156</a> The night before the <i>berith</i> was spent in reading Bible and Talmud, so that the child might from the beginning
breathe, as it were, the atmosphere of <i>torah</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14417src" href="#xd32e14417">157</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb478">[<a href="#pb478">478</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the eighth day the male child is initiated into the covenant of Abraham (Lev. xii.
3). Circumcision is one of “those <i>mitsvoth</i> which the Israelites in times of religious persecution carried out notwithstanding
imminent danger to life.” The performance of this Divine precept is therefore made
the occasion of much rejoicing. In some congregations the operation, as a sacred act,
takes place in the Synagogue after the Morning Service; in others the privacy of the
home is preferred. In ancient days mothers circumcised their sons, but now the operation
is only entrusted to a person who has been duly trained, and has received from competent
judges a certificate of his qualification for the functions of a <i>mohel</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14433src" href="#xd32e14433">158</a> Although, according to the Law, any person, otherwise capable of doing it, may do
the <i>mitsvah</i>, preference is given, and ought to be given, to a person of genuine piety and of
true enthusiasm for our holy Religion, who performs the act <i>in gloriam Dei</i>. Not only the <i>mohel</i>, but all who assist in the act do a <i>mitsvah</i>, and the meal which is prepared for the occasion is a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת מצוה‎</span> (a meal involving a religious act).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14449src" href="#xd32e14449">159</a> Immediately after the operation a name is given to the child.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14467src" href="#xd32e14467">160</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb479">[<a href="#pb479">479</a>]</span></p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.2">The next important moment in a boy’s life is the “Redemption” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פדיון הבן‎</span>) in case of the first-born male child (Exod. xiii. 13, 15), which act is likewise
made the occasion of a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת מצוה‎</span>. A <i>cohen</i> (descendant of Aaron) receives the redemption-money to the amount of five shekels
(or 15s.), according to Num. xviii. 16.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14481src" href="#xd32e14481">161</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.3">In the case of a female child the naming generally takes place in the Synagogue on
a Sabbath, when the father is called up to the Law. In many congregations this takes
place when the mother has sufficiently recovered to attend again for the first time
the Service in the Synagogue on Sabbath. Those who live at a great distance from the
Synagogue pay the first visit to the place of worship on a week-day. A special Service
has been arranged for the occasion.<a class="noteRef" id="ch2.7.9.4src" href="#ch2.7.9.4">162</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.5">Great care is now taken by the parents for the physical well-being of the child, without
entirely ignoring its moral and intellectual development. “At five years the child
is fit to be taught <i>Mikra</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, reading the Bible” (Aboth v. 21), so the Mishnah teaches. But long before this the
child is taught to pray, and to repeat short Biblical passages or prayers in Hebrew.
It must, of course, be borne in mind that children are not all alike, and that each
child must be taught according to its own capacities and <span class="pageNum" id="pb480">[<a href="#pb480">480</a>]</span>strength. The knowledge must be imparted in such a manner that the child should seek
it as a source of pleasure and happiness.
</p>
<p>As to the subjects which are to be taught, there is no branch of general knowledge
from which Jewish children are debarred by their Religion, nor is there any branch
of knowledge that is more Jewish than the rest. Jewish children must learn like other
children, as far as possible, that which is considered necessary and useful, as well
as that which is conducive to the comfort and happiness of life. But <i>Religion</i>, <i>Scripture</i>, and <i>Hebrew</i> must never be absent from the curriculum of studies of a Jewish child. The instruction
in Religion need not occupy much time, for the best teaching of Religion is the good
example set by the parents at home and the teacher in the school. The religious training
of a child should begin early; the surroundings and associations must teach the child
to act nobly, to speak purely, to think charitably, and to love our Religion. “Train
up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it”
(Prov. xxii. 6). Early practical training (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חנוך‎</span>) is also of great importance with regard to the observance of religious precepts.
Children should be accustomed to regard with reverence that which is holy, to honour
Sabbath and Festivals, and to rejoice in doing what the Almighty has commanded. Twice
a year we have special occasion for the fulfilment of this duty, viz., on <i>Simchath-torah</i> and on the <i>Seder</i>-evening.
</p>
<p>In teaching our children Hebrew our aim must be to make them understand the holy language,
to enable them to read the Word of God in the original, and to <span class="pageNum" id="pb481">[<a href="#pb481">481</a>]</span>pray to the Almighty in the language in which the Prophets and the Psalmists gave
utterance to their inspirations, and in which our forefathers addressed the Supreme
Being in the Temple.
</p>
<p>A special ceremony used to introduce the child into the study of the Bible in the
original.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14522src" href="#xd32e14522">163</a> Teacher and pupil went to the Synagogue, took a <i>sepher</i> from the <i>Hechal</i>, and the pupil was made to read the first lesson from the <i>sepher</i>. This and similar ceremonies were intended as a means of impressing on the pupil
the great importance of studying the Word of God in the original language. After having
acquired a sound knowledge of the Bible, the study of other branches of Hebrew literature,
of Talmudical and Rabbinical works, is approached.
</p>
<p>As a rule, boys devote more time to Hebrew studies than girls, only because girls
are considered physically more delicate and not capable of doing so much work as boys.
Girls are by no means excluded from acquiring a sound Hebrew knowledge; on the contrary,
every encouragement should be given to them, if they are inclined to study Hebrew
beyond the first elements.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14534src" href="#xd32e14534">164</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.6">The boy when thirteen years old is <i>bar-mitsvah</i> (lit., “a son of the commandment”), bound to obey the Law, and responsible for his
deeds. On the Sabbath following <span class="pageNum" id="pb482">[<a href="#pb482">482</a>]</span>his thirteenth birthday the boy is called up to the Law; he reads the whole of the
<i>Sidra</i> or a section of it, and declares in the blessings which precede and follow the lesson
his belief in the Divine origin of the Torah, and his gratitude to God for having
given us the Law.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14547src" href="#xd32e14547">165</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.7">The school-years come gradually to a close, and the practical preparation for life
begins. A vocation has to be determined upon. From a moral and religious point of
view all kinds of trade, business, and profession are equal. They are honourable or
base according as they are carried on in an honourable manner or not. Whatever course
is chosen, the moral and religious training must continue with unabated energy. When
the school-years are over, when the youth is no longer under the control of the master,
and is sometimes left even without the control of the parents, he is exposed to various
kinds of temptation, especially through the influence of bad society. The vices against
which the youth must guard himself most at this period of life are sensuality, excessive
desire for pleasure, gambling, and dishonesty, which bring about his moral, social,
and physical ruin. Self-control, acquired through continued religious training, is
the best safeguard against these dangers. It is therefore advisable that those who
have left the school should continue attending some religious class, or otherwise
devote part of their free time to Talmud-torah, to the study of the Torah, and of
works relating to it.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.8">“At the age of eighteen years one is fit for marriage” (Aboth, <i>ibid.</i>) is an ancient dictum, but which <span class="pageNum" id="pb483">[<a href="#pb483">483</a>]</span>could never have been meant as an absolute law. For there are other qualifications
equally important, and even more essential than age. Maimonides (Mishneh-torah, <i>Hil. Deoth</i> v. 11) says: “Man should first secure a living, then prepare a residence, and after
that seek a wife. But fools act otherwise: they marry first, then look out for a house,
and at last think of the means of obtaining a livelihood.” (Comp. Deut. xx. 5–7 and
xxviii. 30.)
</p>
<p>Marriage is called in the Bible “a divine covenant” (Prov. ii. 17), or “the covenant
of God.” God is, as it were, made witness of the covenant; in His presence the assurances
of mutual love and the promises of mutual fidelity are given by husband and wife (Mal.
ii. 14). To break this covenant is therefore not only an offence of the one against
the other, but an offence against God.—In addition to this religious basis of marriage,
conditions of a more material nature were agreed upon. The maiden has been long of
use in the house of her parents, and he who sought the privilege of taking her to
his house and making her his wife had to give to the parents “dowry and gift” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מהר ומתן‎</span>, Gen. xxxiv. 12). Later on, in the time of the Mishnah, all that the husband promised
to his wife was made the subject of a written document (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתובה‎</span>), signed by two witnesses. In this document he guarantees to her 200 <i>zus</i> (or half the sum if she is a widow), the value of her outfit and dowry (in Hebrew
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נדוניא‎</span>), and a certain amount added to the afore-mentioned obligatory sum (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תוספת כתובה‎</span>). He further promises to honour her, work for her, maintain her, and honestly provide
her with everything necessary for her comfort.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb484">[<a href="#pb484">484</a>]</span></p>
<p>The marriage was preceded by the betrothal (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אירוסין‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קידושין‎</span>), the solemn promise on his part to take her after a fixed time to his house as his
wife, and on her part to consider herself as his wife and to prepare herself for the
marriage. Legally she was already his wife, and infidelity was visited with capital
punishment. The interval between the betrothal and marriage used to be twelve months;
at present the two events are united in the marriage ceremony, and are only separated
from each other by an address or by the reading of the <i>kethubhah</i>. That which is now called betrothal or engagement is merely a preliminary settlement
of the conditions of the marriage (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תנאים‎</span> “conditions”). The conditions used to be written down, including a fine (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קנס‎</span>) for breach of promise; the agreement used to be <span class="corr" id="xd32e14603" title="Corrected by author from: concluded">followed</span> by the breaking of a glass<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14606src" href="#xd32e14606">166</a> and by a feast.
</p>
<p>The actual betrothal takes place on the wedding-day, and consists mainly of the following
significant words addressed by the bridegroom to his bride: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הרי את מקודשת לי בטבעת זו כדת משה וישראל‎</span> “Behold, thou art consecrated (betrothed) to me by this ring according to the Law
of Moses and of Israel.” While saying this he places a gold ring<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14616src" href="#xd32e14616">167</a> on the second finger of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb485">[<a href="#pb485">485</a>]</span>right hand. This act is preceded by a <i>berachah</i> over wine, read by the celebrant while holding a cup of wine in his hand, and the
<i>birchath erusin</i> (“blessing of betrothal”), in which God is praised for the institution of Marriage.
Bride and bridegroom, who during the ceremony stand under a canopy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חופה‎</span>), taste of the wine.
</p>
<p>The canopy or <i>chuppah</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14634src" href="#xd32e14634">168</a> represents symbolically the future home of the married couple, which they have to
guard as a sanctuary, and to render inaccessible to evil deeds, words, and thoughts
that would pollute it. The top of the canopy, which is formed of a curtain (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרכת‎</span>) of the <i>Hechal</i>, or of a <i>talith</i>, expresses the idea of sanctity.
</p>
<p>After the <i>birchath erusin</i> the bridegroom makes the solemn declaration<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14657src" href="#xd32e14657">169</a> mentioned above: “Behold, thou art consecrated (betrothed) unto me by this ring according
to the Law of Moses and of Israel,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14663src" href="#xd32e14663">170</a> whereupon the <i>kethubhah</i> is read in Aramaic<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14670src" href="#xd32e14670">171</a> or in English, <span class="pageNum" id="pb486a">[<a href="#pb486a">486</a>]</span>and an address is sometimes given. Then follow the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכות נשואין‎</span> (“Blessings of Marriage”), called also after their number <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע ברכות‎</span> “Seven Blessings.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14690src" href="#xd32e14690">172</a> The ceremony concludes with the breaking of a glass and the mutual congratulations
of friends and relatives, expressed in the words <i>Mazzal-tobh</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מזל טוב‎</span> “Good luck”).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14699src" href="#xd32e14699">173</a>
</p>
<p>A banquet (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת נישואין‎</span>) follows, which is a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת מצוה‎</span>. It is introduced by the usual <i>berachah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המוציא‎</span>), and followed by Grace and the “Seven Blessings.”
</p>
<p>The following are a few of the various customs connected with a Jewish marriage without
being essential elements of the marriage ceremony:—
</p>
<p>(1.) On the Sabbath previous to the wedding-day the bridegroom, his father, and the
father of the bride are called up to the Law, and offerings are made (<i>mi shebberach</i>) in honour of the bride and the bridegroom. In some congregations Gen. xxiv. is read
after the Service, on the morning of the wedding-day.
</p>
<p>(2.) Bride and bridegroom enter upon a new life; the wedding-day is to them a day
of rejoicing, but also a day of great solemnity. It is kept as a day of earnest reflections,
of prayer and fasting, till after <span class="pageNum" id="pb487">[<a href="#pb487">487</a>]</span>the ceremony, when the fast is broken and the rejoicing begins. The bridegroom adds
in the <i>Minchah amidah</i> the Confession (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ודוי‎</span>) of the Day of Atonement.
</p>
<p>(3.) The good wishes of friends and relatives are variously expressed. Rice, wheat,
or similar things are thrown over the bride and the bridegroom as a symbol of abundance
and fruitfulness.
</p>
<p>(4.) The feast is accompanied by speeches in praise of the bride and bridegroom; it
was considered a special merit to speak on such an occasion (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אגרא דהלולא מילי‎</span>, Babyl. Talm., Berachoth 6b). The bridegroom used to give a discourse (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דרשה‎</span>) on some Talmudical theme, if he was able to do so. He received presents for it (<i>derashah</i>-presents).
</p>
<p>(5.) In the time of the Bible and the Talmud the feasting lasted seven days.—The first
day after the wedding used to be distinguished by a fish dinner (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סעודת דגים‎</span>), in allusion to Gen. xlviii. 16.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.9">In spite of all blessings and good wishes the marriage sometimes proves a failure,
husband and wife being a source of trouble and misery the one to the other, instead
of being the cause of each other’s happiness. In such a case a divorce may take place,
and man and wife separate from each other. Divorce is permitted (Deut. xxiv. 1–4),
but not encouraged; it is an evil, but the lesser of two evils. A written document
was required (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר כריתות‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גט‎</span>), and later legislation made the writing and the delivery of the document difficult
and protracted, in order to facilitate attempts at reconciliation; the fulfilment
of the conditions agreed upon in the <i>kethubhah</i> also tended to <span class="pageNum" id="pb488">[<a href="#pb488">488</a>]</span>render divorce a rare event. The number of cases of divorce among the Jews is therefore
comparatively smaller than among other denominations, but still unfortunately far
too large, owing to want of foresight and reflection in the choice of a companion
for life.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.10">There is a kind of obligatory marriage (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יבום‎</span>) and or obligatory divorce (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חליצה‎</span>), viz., with regard to the widow of a deceased brother who has died without issue
(Deut. xxv. 5–10). Since the abolition of polygamy<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14767src" href="#xd32e14767">174</a> by Rabbenu Gershom (eleventh century) the obligatory marriage has almost disappeared,
and the obligatory divorce (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חליצה‎</span>) must take place before the widow can marry again.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14778src" href="#xd32e14778">175</a>
</p>
<p>We acknowledge the principle laid down in the Talmud, “The law of the country is binding
upon us” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דינא דמלכותא דינא‎</span>), but only in so far as our civil relations are concerned. With regard to religious
questions our own religious code must be obeyed. Marriage laws include two elements—civil
relations and religious duties. As regards the former, we abide by the decisions of
the civil courts of the country. We must, therefore, not solemnise a marriage which
the law of the country would not recognise; we must not religiously dissolve a marriage
by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גט‎</span>, unless the civil courts of law have already decreed the divorce. On the other hand,
we must not content ourselves <span class="pageNum" id="pb489">[<a href="#pb489">489</a>]</span>with civil marriage or civil divorce; religiously, neither civil marriage nor civil
divorce can be recognised unless supplemented by marriage or divorce according to
religious forms. Furthermore, marriages allowed by the civil law, but prohibited by
our religious law—<i>e.g.</i>, mixed marriages; that is, marriages between Jews and non-Jews—cannot be recognised
before the tribunal of our Religion; such alliances are sinful, and the issue of such
alliances must be treated as illegitimate. Those who love their Religion and have
the well-being of Judaism at heart will do their utmost to prevent the increase of
mixed marriages.
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.11">“To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a
time to be born, and a time to die” (Eccles. iii. 1, 2). Life is a precious gift the
Creator has given us; while there is breath in our nostrils we thank Him for it, we
pray to Him for its prolongation, do everything in our power to preserve it, and consider
its wilful destruction a criminal act. But notwithstanding all this “there is a time
to die.” Life and death are equally mysteries to us; we trust in the mercy of Him
who has ordained life and death, that both are for our good. Death is, therefore,
not to be regarded with dread and horror; it is the transition to another state of
life, the real nature of which is unknown to us. But it is our belief that the future
life (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏העולם הבא‎</span>) is infinitely superior to the present life (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏העולם הזה‎</span>); hence the saying in the Midrash that the words “exceedingly good” (Gen. i. 31)
applied to death. The only fear of death that can reasonably be justified is the fear
of departing from this life before we have completed our task, before we have sufficiently
<span class="pageNum" id="pb490">[<a href="#pb490">490</a>]</span>strengthened “the breaches of the house” caused by our own dereliction of duty. Our
Sages advise, “Return one day before thy death” (Aboth ii. 15); that is, every day,
the day of death being concealed from our knowledge. In this manner we constantly
prepare ourselves for death without curtailing our enjoyment of life. “Rejoice, O
young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and
walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that
for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove sorrow from
thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity” (Eccles.
xi. 9, 10). When passion overcomes us and evil inclinations invite us to sin, we are
told by our Sages to remember the day of death, which may suddenly surprise us before
we have been able by repentance to purify ourselves from our transgressions (Babyl.
Talm., Berachoth 5<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>When death approaches, and announces itself through man’s illness, we do everything
that human knowledge and skill can suggest to preserve and prolong the earthly life
with which God has endowed us; in addition, the patient himself and his friends invoke
the mercy of God for his recovery.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14815src" href="#xd32e14815">176</a> Even when death appears invincible, when “the edge of the sword touches already man’s
neck, we do not relinquish our hope in God’s mercy, and continue to pray to the All-merciful.”
The patient is asked to <span class="pageNum" id="pb491">[<a href="#pb491">491</a>]</span>prepare himself for the solemn moment, although it may in reality be as yet far off.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14823src" href="#xd32e14823">177</a> The preparation consists of prayer, meditation, confession of sin, repentance, and
of the profession of our Creed, especially of the Unity of God, in the words, “Hear,
O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14828src" href="#xd32e14828">178</a> To visit the sick, to comfort them by kind words and deeds, to pray with and for
the patient, are acts included in the duty of “<span class="corr" id="xd32e14834" title="Corrected by author from: visiting of">visiting</span> the sick” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בקור הולים‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14841src" href="#xd32e14841">179</a> In the moment of death those present testify their faith in God by proclaiming the
Dominion, the Omnipotence, and the Unity of God in the same way in which we make this
declaration at the conclusion of the Day of Atonement. Although Prayer-books contain
certain forms of prayer for this purpose, the patient and those present should rather
follow the impulse of their heart, and commune with the Almighty in any form their
heart suggests.
</p>
<p>When life has come to an end friends and relatives give free expression to their grief;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14848src" href="#xd32e14848">180</a> to check it by comforting words at this moment is useless (Aboth iv. 18). The mourners,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14857src" href="#xd32e14857">181</a> father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and sister, have now to direct all their
attention <span class="pageNum" id="pb492">[<a href="#pb492">492</a>]</span>to the deceased relative, in order that nothing be neglected in the last honours shown
to him; they are therefore free from all other religious obligations till after the
burial. In Palestine and neighbouring countries, where, in consequence of the higher
temperature, decomposition of the body begins soon after death, the burial takes place
on the same day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14868src" href="#xd32e14868">182</a> In colder climates two or three days elapse between death and burial. The mourners
abstain during the interval from wine and meat.
</p>
<p>Every act of piety in honour of the deceased is a meritorious religious act, a <i>mitsvah</i>, an act of kindness and truth (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד ואמת‎</span>), and in every congregation there exists a society, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חברא קרישא‎</span> “holy society,” whose members devote themselves to the fulfilment of these pious
duties.
</p>
<p>According to the principle that death equalises all, that “the small and great are
there” (Job iii. 19), the greatest simplicity and equality is observed in all matters
connected with the obsequies<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14884src" href="#xd32e14884">183</a> of the dead. Friends and relatives follow to the burial-ground; the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלוית המת‎</span>, or attending the dead to their last resting-place,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14898src" href="#xd32e14898">184</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb493">[<a href="#pb493">493</a>]</span>is one of those <i>mitsvoth</i> “the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the stock remains for him
for the world to come.”
</p>
<p>Burying the dead is a very old custom, to which the Jews adhered firmly at all ages.
The custom of the Greeks, who burnt their dead, found no advocates among the Jews.
In the Written and the Oral Law only the burying of the dead is mentioned. To leave
a human body unburied and unattended was considered by Jews, as by other nations,
an insult to the deceased person, and whoever found such a body was bound to take
charge of it and to effect its burial.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14917src" href="#xd32e14917">185</a>
</p>
<p>In the Burial Service we acknowledge the justice of God, and resign ourselves to the
Will of the Almighty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדוק הדין‎</span>). When the burial is over our attention is directed to the living; words of comfort
are addressed to the mourners<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14930src" href="#xd32e14930">186</a> who return home and keep <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבעה‎</span> “seven days of mourning.” A certain degree of mourning is then continued till the
end of <span class="pageNum" id="pb494">[<a href="#pb494">494</a>]</span>the year by the children of the deceased, and till the end of the month (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלשים‎</span> “thirty days”) by other relatives.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14953src" href="#xd32e14953">187</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.7.9.12">Our regard for the deceased (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יקרא דשכבי‎</span>) and our sympathies with the mourners (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יקרא דחיי‎</span>) are expressed in different ways.
</p>
<p>The funeral oration (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הספד‎</span>) occasionally spoken at the grave, or in the house of mourning, or in the Synagogue,
generally combines both elements; it contains a eulogy upon the deceased and words
of sympathy and exhortation for the living.
</p>
<p>The special prayers offered up on such occasions likewise include these two elements:
petitions for the well-being of the soul of the deceased, that it may find Divine
mercy when appearing before the Supreme Judge, and petitions for the comfort and relief
of the mourners. The <i>Kaddish</i> of the Mourners, however, does not contain such prayers, but merely expresses their
resignation to the Will of the Almighty, their conviction that He is the only Being
that is to be worshipped, and that He alone will be worshipped by all mankind in the
days of Messiah, and their wish that the arrival of those days may be hastened.
</p>
<p>There are, besides, the following customs, the object <span class="pageNum" id="pb495">[<a href="#pb495">495</a>]</span>of which is to express our regard for the memory of the deceased: (1.) A tombstone
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצבה‎</span>) is set up in front of or over the grave with the name of the deceased, the date
of his death, and such words of praise as are dictated by the love and the esteem
in which the deceased was held by the mourners. (2.) A lamp is kept burning<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14983src" href="#xd32e14983">188</a> during the week, or the month, or the year of mourning, and on the anniversary of
the day of death (<i lang="de">Jahrzeit</i>). (3.) By observing the anniversary of the death as a day devoted to earnest reflection,
and to meditation on the merits and virtues of the deceased; we keep away from amusements,
and say <i>Kaddish</i> in the course of the Services of the day. Some observe the anniversary as a fast-day.
(4.) By doing some <i>mitsvah</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14993src" href="#xd32e14993">189</a> in commemoration of the deceased. (5.) By regarding with respect and piety the wishes
of the departed relative or friend, especially those uttered when death was approaching.
Our Sages teach: “It is our duty to fulfil the wishes of the departed.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15014src" href="#xd32e15014">190</a> The absence of this inner respect and piety makes all the outward signs of mourning,
however conscientiously observed, valueless and illusory.

<p class="first">In addition to the customs already mentioned, there are a few calling for some observation,
customs which might seem superstitious, but are not so if properly understood.
</p>
<p>When life is extinct the eyes of the deceased are closed, and in some cases also the
mouth is kept shut. This is probably done out of regard for the dead, that their face
should not present a too ghastly and repulsive appearance. The custom is mentioned
in the Mishnah, Shabbath xxiii. 5, and is also alluded to in the words, “And Joseph
shall put his hands upon thine eyes” (Gen. xlvi. 4).
</p>
<p>From the house in which there was a dead person, and from the houses in its immediate
neighbourhood, the water was poured out. According to Num. xix., everything in the
house—and, under certain conditions, also in the neighbouring houses—was unclean;
the water was poured out, from fear lest it be used in preparing holy food, such as
<i>terumah</i> (“heave-offering”). Furthermore, a <i>kohen</i> is not allowed to enter such a house, and the pouring away of the water served as
an indication that a dead person was in the house.
</p>
<p>An important element in the preparation for the burial is the “cleaning” and robing
of the body (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרה‎</span>); the cleansing of the body before it returns to the earth is to be a symbol of the
purification of the soul by the mercy of God.
</p>
<p>It is customary that those who came into contact with the deceased during his lifetime
express regret for any offence they may have committed, knowingly or unknowingly,
against him—a good custom, that might serve as an exhortation to us all to be careful
in our actions towards our living fellow-men.
</p>
<p>Whenever we mention the name of a deceased friend or relative we add, as a mark of
respect, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עליהן) השלום‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלין (עליה עליהם‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכרונו (זכרונה) לברכה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זכר צדיק לברכה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוחו (נוחה) עדן‎</span> (abbreviated, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זצל, ז״ל, ע״ה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נ״ע‎</span>), “Peace be to him (her or them),” “his (or her) memory be for a blessing,” “the
memory of the righteous be for a blessing,” or “his (or her) rest be Eden.” Comp.

Similarly we add to the names of living friends and relatives the wish <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיחיה‎</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שתחיה‎</span>), or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נרו יאיר‎</span> “May he (or she) live,” or “May his light continue to shine.”

<p class="footnote cont">2. <i>Erubh chatseroth</i> (lit., “combination of the houses in a court”). According to the traditional law,
we must not carry anything on Sabbath from a private place (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות היחיד‎</span>) into the street (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות הרבים‎</span>). The former is defined to be a locality belonging to one person or family, and separated
from the public by a fence. The Jewish inhabitants of a court or a town closed on
all sides combine to form one family, and thus turn the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות הרבים‎</span> into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות היחיד‎</span>. The symbol of such combination consists of some food kept in a room, to which all
have access (<i>e.g.</i>, the Synagogue). This is the origin and meaning of the Passover-cake (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מצה‎</span>) which may still be noticed in some of the Continental Synagogues.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">3. <i>Erubh par excellence.</i>—An opening left in a fence or wall round a <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רשות היחיד‎</span> must at least have some token that indicates the closing of the space; <i>e.g.</i>, a wire drawn through the open space from one part of the fence to the other. Such
symbol is called <i>erubh</i>, “combination of the various parts of the fence or wall into one.” Such <i>erubh</i> may likewise be noticed in some of the Continental towns. In all these cases the
symbol was not introduced for the purpose of permitting the actual transgression of
a law, but rather for the purpose of reminding us of what the law forbids us to do;
since, in fact, that which becomes permitted through these symbols is even in their
absence no direct breach of any of the Sabbath laws.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e9495src" title="Return to note 37 in text.">↑</a></p>

the <i>berachah</i> is said. The origin of this custom is this: the rule has been laid down that there
should not be a long interval between the <i>berachah</i> and the partaking of the food. The knife and the bread are therefore kept ready,
and originally an incision was made into the loaf in order to shorten that interval

that the housewife is not ready in time for kindling the lights, and lets another

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e10372src">60</a></span> Various reasons are given for this title. According to Tradition, the 10th of <i>Nisan</i> in the year of the Exodus was on Saturday; it was considered a great event, a miracle,
in fact, that the Israelites could on that day select a lamb for sacrifice without
being molested by their Egyptian masters, who at other times would have stoned them
for such daring (Exod. viii. 22). Another reason is this: The Sabbath before any of
the chief Festivals was called the great Sabbath on account of <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>the instruction sought and given respecting the importance and the observances of
the coming Festival (see Zunz, Ritus. p. 9). This name has only been preserved in
the case of the Sabbath before Passover.—It is, however, possible that “the great
day,” the predominant idea in the <i>haphtarah</i> of the day, suggested the name.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e10408src">61</a></span> The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פסח‎</span> “Passover,” signifies (1) the act of passing over or sparing (Exod. xii. 11); (2)
the sacrifice of passover, especially as object to the verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשה‎</span> “to make” (<i>ibid.</i> 47, 48); (3) the time when the passover was offered and consumed; <i>i.e.</i>, the 14th of <i>Nisan</i>, afternoon and evening (Lev. xxiii. 5; Num. xxviii. 16); (4) the whole of Passover
(Mishnah, and in all post-Biblical literature).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The day on which an Israelite brought a sacrifice was a Festival to him and his family;
and no work was done on that day. Accordingly on the afternoon of the 14th of <i>Nisan</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערב פסח‎</span>, the time fixed for the Passover-offering, no work was done; some abstained from
<span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>work the whole day (Mishnah, Pesachim iv. 1; comp. also <i>ibid.</i> 5).—It is customary for the first-born to fast the whole or part of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערב פסח‎</span> (Talm. Jerus. x. 1, and Masecheth Soferim xxi. 3). They might rather be expected
to feast in memory of the deliverance of the first-born Israelites in Egypt. But the
case is similar to that of <i>Purim</i>. Both the day of danger and the day of victory are celebrated; the one by fasting
(fast of Esther), the other by feasting (<i>Purim</i>). So here the 14th of <i>Nisan</i> was for the first-born the day of danger, the following night the season of deliverance.
Hence the fasting during the day and the feasting in the evening. The day suggests
thoughts like the following: Our forefathers were saved from danger: should we deserve
to be saved if danger threatened us? Such reflections may have been the origin of
the fast of the first-born on the eve of Passover. Some also fast on this day, or
at least abstain on it from a full meal, in order to do honour to the festive meal
in the evening and approach it with appetite (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לתיאבון‎</span>). A similar custom obtains, though not to the same extent, on the eve of Sabbath

of God led them, without taking with them any provision for the journey. The lamb
which they had prepared was to be consumed before they left Egypt, and whatever was
left had to be burnt. This was probably also the object of the precepts that no bone
of the lamb was to be broken, and no part of it was to be carried from one house to
another; for the breaking of the bones and the carrying part of the meat about from
place to place would facilitate its being stored away for the journey.—Other precepts,
which implied haste and readiness, <i>e.g.</i>, the roasting it with fire, eating it with loins girded, &amp;c., were to teach the Israelites
the lesson that they were to be always ready and willing to do God’s bidding.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e10484src" title="Return to note 63 in text.">↑</a></p>

added, beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפך חמתך‎</span> and containing a prayer for God’s wrath to be poured forth over the godless people
who seek the destruction of Israel. The cause of the addition is this: The season
of Passover was, in the Middle Ages, a season of constant terror and danger to the
Jews, because of the hostilities of their Christian neighbours against them. Helpless
and defenceless, the Jews had no other way of meeting their foe than to cry to Him
“who is near to all who call upon Him in truth.” The conduct of their neighbours towards
them hardly suggested thoughts of love, especially at that moment. For it frequently
happened that several families met in one house for the purpose of hearing the Seder-Service.
They dispersed after the first part of the Service, took their meals at home, and
assembled later in the evening for the second part of the Seder. Sometimes another
course was taken. One person read the Service in several houses consecutively for
the benefit of those who were not capable of doing so for themselves; then, after
having had his meal, he began his circuit again for reading the second part of the
Service. The return of the Reader or of the several families was anxiously waited
for. The opening of the door before <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפך חמתך‎</span>, at present meaningless, had its origin in this circumstance. On returning to the
second part of the Service, the guests had too often a sad tale to tell of their experiences
in the street, and filled with indignation, they gave expression to their feeling
in the above verses. We continue to read these verses now, but in a different spirit.
We live in peace with our neighbours, protected by the laws of the country and unmolested
in the performance of our religious duties. We have nothing but feelings and thoughts
of love for our fellow-men, and in reciting these verses we merely condemn the wickedness
of those who seek the destruction of the people of the Lord. Our Christian neighbours
may certainly join us in this condemnation.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11061src" title="Return to note 87 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote cont">It is an old custom to take a few extra twigs of the willow-tree on this day and keep
them in one’s hand during the chanting of the <i>hoshaanoth</i>. These branches, when shaken or struck, lose their leaves one after the other; so
do the trees from which the branches have been cut, and so also all other trees. But
the rain and heat sent by God in due time give them fresh life, and they produce new
leaves. A similar experience is ours. The struggle for life reduces our strength and
weakens our health; cares and troubles discourage us. But faith in God and trust in
His Providence renew our strength; our health improves, our cares and troubles are

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e11621src">100</a></span> Whilst the three Festivals demanded great sacrifices of each individual Israelite—to
undertake a pilgrimage to the Temple, and not to appear empty before the Lord—the
“Solemn Days” demanded only abstention from work, and on one day also from food. The
Sacrificial Service on the Day of Atonement concerned directly the High-Priest and
the priests in the Temple, the public at large but indirectly; and if great multitudes
assembled in the Temple, it was curiosity rather than duty that brought them there.
More importance was therefore attached by chroniclers and historians to the three
Festivals and the national gathering in and round the Temple on the Feasts of Pilgrimage
than to the Day of Memorial or the Day of Atonement. The Law <span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401">401</a>]</span>deemed it necessary to urge on the Israelites the celebration of the former more frequently
than that of the latter. When Solomon at the dedication of the Temple celebrated with
the Israelites twice seven days, the first seven days probably commenced the 1st of
<i>Tishri</i> on the Festival (1 Kings viii. 2), and the second seven days on the 15th of the month;
therefore they are reckoned separately (<i>ibid.</i> viii. 65; 2 Chron. vii. 9, 10). Ezra, who read the Law to the Jews on the 1st of
<i>Tishri</i> (Neh. viii. 2), which was a Holy-day (<i>ibid.</i> 10), read it also on the second day, which may likewise have been a special day for
reading the Law, probably the Day of Atonement, and here they learnt that they were
commanded to build booths for the next Festival. They must therefore have heard Leviticus
xxiii., which includes the commandment concerning the fasting on the Day of Atonement.
It may also be noticed that, although the commandment concerning the Day of Atonement
is not mentioned in Exodus, the day is referred to as a well-known institution (Exod.
xxx. 10).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11621src" title="Return to note 100 in text.">↑</a></p>

<div class="fndiv" id="xd32e11645">
<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e11645src">101</a></span> The reason Tradition assigns for this observance is as follows: After the giving of
the Law Moses ascended Mount Sinai on the 7th of <i>Sivan</i>, and descended on the fortieth day, the 17th of <i>Tammuz</i>, with the tables of testimony. On the 18th he ascended again, and spent forty days
in prayer for forgiveness for Israel; and ascended for the third time on the 1st of
<i>Elul</i>, and returned on the 10th of <i>Tishri</i> with the Divine message, “I have pardoned in accordance with thy words of prayer.”
Cherishing the hope that we may ourselves receive such a heavenly response on the
Day of Atonement, we follow the example of Moses, and add these <i>Selichoth</i> or devotional exercises to our daily prayers, while the sound of the <i>shofar</i> aids in awakening us to earnest reflection and true improvement.

which water has on the body, and to be reminded that even as the body is purified
by water, so ought our souls be purified by repentance and the appeal to the help
and mercy of God. An appropriate passage from Micah (vii. 18–20) is recited, and the
custom has received its name <i>tashlich</i> from the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ותשליך‎</span> “and thou wilt cast,” which occurs in the passage.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11845src" title="Return to note 106 in text.">↑</a></p>

those who have not themselves committed the sins mentioned in the confession regret
that they were unable to prevent them from being committed by others. The form of
the confession is therefore in the plural: “We have been guilty,” &amp;c. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבל אנחנו חטאנו‎</span> “Indeed we have sinned,” would suffice for the purpose of confession. But the long
lists of various forms of sins in the sections beginning <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשמנו‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על חטא‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על חטאים‎</span> and which are repeatedly recited during the Service, help us to remember our misdoings;
what has escaped our attention the first time may be revived in our memory, when we
read the confession a second or third time. Especially numerous are the terms denoting
sins committed with our tongue; and indeed they are numerous! And where is the person
that could say that his tongue has never been employed in falsehood, or slander, or
self-praise, or hasty promises, and similar offences? It is necessary that we should
reflect over and over again on these vices, and on the way in which to obtain better
control over our tongue, and thereby a fuller mastery over the passions of our heart.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11913src" title="Return to note 107 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e11954src">108</a></span> The Evening Service is preceded by a formal rescinding of previous vows. Of what kind
were the vows which are thus annulled? None of those that were made by a member of
the community individually. No one can by means of this formula free himself from
the obligation to fulfil what he has promised to his fellow-man. The declaration concerns
the whole congregation, and has probably its origin in the customs of former days,
when those who refused to join in the communal work, or to submit to the law of the
congregation, or shocked by any act of theirs the conscience of their brethren, or
abandoned Judaism outwardly, were excommunicated and shut out from all contact with
their co-religionists. Such transgressors, <i>abarjanim</i>, when desirous to pray in the Synagogue on the Day of Atonement, were admitted, and
all opposition was silenced by the solemn declaration.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">That such was the original object of <i>Kol-nidre</i> is sufficiently clear from its surroundings. It is preceded by the following announcement:
“In the name of God, and in the name of the congregation, with the sanction of the
Court above, and that of the Court below, we declare that it is permitted to pray
together with those who have been transgressors (<i>abarjanim</i>).” <i>Kol-nidre</i> is followed by the verse, “And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
of Israel, <i>and the stranger that sojourneth among them</i>; seeing all the people were in ignorance” (Num. xv. 26).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The original object of this declaration does not apply at present; but it serves as
a reminder of the following principles:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">1. We should always be disposed to forgive those who, in the heat of strife, acting
under strong irritation, have offended us.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">2. We should be careful with regard to vows, and before making them consider their
effect.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">3. We should reflect on human weakness, and consider that what we believe to be able
to do to-day may prove impossible for us to-morrow. This reflection would remove every
thought of pride from our heart and inspire us with humility.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11954src" title="Return to note 108 in text.">↑</a></p>

destroy the corners of thy beard” (Lev. xix. 27), a razor is not employed, and shaving
is avoided; the hair of the beard and the face is clipped with scissors. This prohibition,
like that of “rounding the corners of the head” (<i>ibid.</i>), belongs to a group of precepts which aimed at keeping the Israelites away from
the idolatrous customs of their heathen neighbours. The second prohibition has led
to the fashion noticeable among Russian and Polish Jews of letting the hair of “the
corners of the head” (in Hebrew <i>peoth</i>) grow very long.—In the Mishnah (Kethubhoth vii. 6) it is mentioned as a distinctively
“Jewish custom” that married women have their head covered when going out. Many Jewish
women observe also this <span class="pageNum" id="pb468">[<a href="#pb468">468</a>]</span>custom within the house.—With these exceptions there is nothing in his dress and appearance
that need distinguish the Jew from the Gentile, only that sometimes Jews are more
conservative with regard to fashion than their neighbours, and old-fashioned style
is then mistaken for “Jewish fashion.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e14156src" title="Return to note 144 in text.">↑</a></p>

as a sign of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. From the same
reason, in some congregations, the bridegroom on the wedding-day has ashes strewn
on his head. In accordance with Ps. cxxxvii. 6 we remember Jerusalem on various occasions.
We recite Ps. cxxxvii. on week-days, and Ps. cxxvi. on Sabbath and Holy-days, after
every meal. Again, when we give expression to our sympathy with mourners we pray that
God may comfort them together with those who mourn for the destruction of Jerusalem.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e14176src" title="Return to note 145 in text.">↑</a></p>

ceremony as well as in the case of a divorce, have been erroneously interpreted as
evidence of the low estimate in which she is held by the Jewish Law. How the Jews
were taught to honour their wives may be gathered from the Jewish marriage document,
in which the husband promises “to honour his wife in accordance with the rule in practice
among Jews, that every husband honours his wife.” There are, unfortunately, also bad
Jews who ill-treat, neglect, or entirely abandon their wives; but these cases are
exceptions, and proportionately less numerous than among non-Jews. On the whole, Jewish
women are treated by their husbands with love and regard, and the good relations that
exist between husband and wife ensure the comfort and happiness of both.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e14235src" title="Return to note 146 in text.">↑</a></p>

</p>
<p class="small"><span class="sc">Note.</span>—The 15th of Shebhat is, according to the opinion of the Hillelites (Mishnah, Rosh
ha-shanah i. 1), “New-year for the trees;” <i>i.e.</i>, in reference to tithes, and to the fruit of the fourth or fifth year (Lev. xix.
24, 25); the fruit that begins to grow on a tree between the 15th of Shebhat of one
year and the same date next year is reckoned as the fruit of one year.
</p>
<p class="small">Various reasons are given for the distinction of the 15th of Ab: (<i>a.</i>) The punishment decreed against the Israelites in the wilderness in connection with
the spies (Num. xiv. 29) was discontinued from the 15th of Ab. (<i>b.</i>) The posts set up by Jeroboam on the borders of his kingdom for the purpose of preventing
Israelites from going up to Jerusalem were removed on this date. (<i>c.</i>) The preparation of the wood for the altar was completed on the 15th of Ab. (<i>d.</i>) On this day the Israelites obtained permission to bury the bodies of those killed
in the war against Hadrian. (<i>e.</i>) The reconciliation <span class="pageNum" id="pb501">[<a href="#pb501">501</a>]</span>between the Benjamites and the other Israelites took place on the 15th of Ab (Judges
xxi. 21 <i>sqq.</i>).
</p>
<p class="small">The Mishnah (Taanith iv. 8) states that the 15th of Ab and the Day of Atonement were
to the Israelites once days of the greatest national rejoicings for all alike, rich
and poor. In memory of these general rejoicings the daughters of Jerusalem wore on
these days borrowed white garments, in order that those poor who had none of their
own should not feel ashamed. The Mishnah then describes the causes of the rejoicings;
namely, the dancings in the vineyards (Judges, <i>l. c.</i>) for the 15th of Ab, and the giving of the Law (<i>i.e.</i>, the giving of the second tables, which, according to Tradition, took place on the
10th of Tishri), and the building of the Temple (<i>i.e.</i>, the rearing of the Tabernacle, which, according to Tradition, was commanded on the
10th of Tishri for the rejoicings on the Day of Atonement).

<h3 class="main">RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professor Lazarus in his recent work “<span lang="de">Die Ethik <span class="corr" id="xd32e15510" title="Source: der">des</span> Judenthums</span>” made the following observations: “In the continuity of the spirit of our nation
we discover the solution of the riddle, which puzzled so many thinkers, viz.: how
the small tribe of the Jews managed to outlive great and mighty nations.” This continuity
of the spirit has been secured by our religious education. It has been said that education
aims at producing in the younger generation the capacity of receiving, preserving
and developing the culture we have acquired; this applies pre-eminently to religious
education. That such continuity exists in our religious education, is evident from
the fact that up to the present day the chief text-book for religious instruction
has remained the same:—the Torah, or in a wider sense, the Bible, that everflowing
fountain of living waters, not only for us Jews, but for almost all civilised nations.
Our duty to preserve this continuity by handing over to the next generation the religious
principles inherited from our predecessors is frequently insisted upon in Holy Writ,
and emphasized on every occasion. We have in this respect a double duty to perform:
Every parent is bound to secure as far as possible the well-being of his children;
religious education <span class="pageNum" id="pb503">[<a href="#pb503">503</a>]</span>is indispensable for the children’s well-being. The Torah, the source of our religious
education, is besides, our National treasure and inheritance, and every member of
our community has as such the duty to guard and protect this treasure, that the rising
generation receive it in its integrity. It is therefore not sufficient for any one
of us to provide for the religious instruction of his own children, it is his duty
to contribute his share towards the maintenance of the public schools or classes established
for the religious instruction of the young. The Israelites in the wilderness joyfully
received the National treasure, and solemnly declared “the Law which Moses commanded
us, has been handed to us as an inheritance,” to be transmitted from generation to
generation. These very words form the beginning of the religious education of our
children, for as soon as they are able to speak, they are taught to recite and to
understand the verse <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה קהלת יעקב‎</span> “The Law which Moses commanded us, O congregation of Jacob, is an inheritance.” (Deut.
xxxiii. 4.). In accordance with this principle, the Torah, the reading of the Torah
in its original language, in the Hebrew, the translation and the understanding of
the Torah, must form the basis of Jewish Religious Education, both in private and
public instruction. The Torah is the essential element in the curriculum of Jewish
Institutions for Religious instruction<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>Our Sages therefore teach (Aboth v. 2): “Read the Torah again and again, for everything
is in it, and in it thou wilt see everything; and even when thou art old and worn
out, remain faithful to it, and from it do not move away, for there is no better measure
for thee than the Torah.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb504">[<a href="#pb504">504</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are other important subjects which Jewish children of both sexes are expected
to learn and to know: The principles of Religion, Scripture History, Jewish History
and Literature, Geography of Palestine and Hebrew Grammar. None of these subjects
should be excluded from the curriculum of a Jewish School. They must be taught, but
must be taught in such a way that they help to illustrate the lessons of the Law,
and to facilitate its study. It is certainly of great importance that our children
should acquire as much knowledge as possible of our History and Literature; of far
greater importance, however, is the training of the heart in the faith of God, the
inculcation of reverence for the Torah and the creation of a desire to live a pure,
good and holy life, based on the fear and love of God. Text-books of Religion, though
useful both to teacher and pupil, must by no means supersede the original, the Torah.
Where for some cogent reason a minimum of time is spared for religious instruction—as
is <i>e.g.</i> the case in many Religion Classes connected with Public Schools and Colleges, special
care should be taken that the Torah receive its due attention. The best method must
be employed, the best possible teachers must be engaged, who are well trained in the
art of teaching, and possess a thorough knowledge of our holy religion and our history.
If in addition to these qualifications, the teacher devotes himself to his profession
with love and enthusiasm, his words, coming from the heart, will find their way into
the heart of the pupil. No time can be spared for metaphysical speculations or for
problems of Bible criticism. Besides, “The hidden things belong to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb505">[<a href="#pb505">505</a>]</span>Lord our God, but the things which have been revealed are for us and our children
for ever: to do all the words of this Law.” (Deut. xxix. 28). According to the teaching
of Aboth, (v. 22) “one moment of victory over sin and temptation in this life surpasses
all the blessings of the future life,” and to train our youths in the way leading
to such bliss, is the aim and motive of all Religious teaching.

humbly venture to raise my eyes unto Thee, and to declare, with sincerity and truth,
that henceforth I will observe all Thy commandments, and undertake and bear the responsibility
of all mine actions towards Thee. In my earliest infancy I was brought within Thy
sacred covenant with Israel, and to-day I again enter as an active responsible member,
the pale of Thine elect congregation, in the midst of which I will never cease to
glorify Thy holy name in the face of all nations.
</p>
<p>Do Thou, O Heavenly Father, hearken unto this my humble prayer, and vouchsafe unto
me Thy gracious blessings, so that my earthly life may be sustained and made happy
by Thine ineffable mercies. Teach me the way of Thy statutes, that I may obey them,
and faithfully carry out Thine ordinances. Dispose my heart to love Thee and to fear
Thy holy name, and grant me Thy support and the strength necessary to avoid the worldly
dangers which encompass the path lying before me. Save me from temptation, so that
I may with fortitude observe Thy holy Law, and those precepts on which human happiness
and eternal life depend. Thus I will every day of my life trustfully and gladly proclaim:

<p class="first">Religious books for the use of children at home or in school were unknown in olden
times. The Torah was taught, and with it every thing else. A great part of the Book
of Proverbs and many of the Psalms may have been intended for the education of the
young. In the early post-Biblical time we meet with books like The Wisdom of Solomon,
The Wisdom of Joshua, son of Sirach, and Sayings of the Fathers, which may have served
the same purpose. To these may be added “The Duties of the Heart,” by Bachya ibn Pekuda,
“The Examination of the World” (Bechinath Olam), “The Choice of the Pearls,” by Ibn
Gabirol, Abraham ibn Ezra’s “Foundation of the Fear of God, and Principle of the Law,”
and “The Book of the Righteous,” by Rabbenu Jacob Tam, and “The Moral Lessons” (Toaliyyoth)
by Rabbi Levi ben Gerson, and “The Shulhan Aruch” of R. Judah Aryeh di Modena. All
these works are excellent books for the instruction of the young<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> They inculcate religious lessons, and shew the way to a pious life, but they are
not text books of religion in the modern sense of the term. This branch of literature
began to develop in the last century, with the exception of Abraham Jaghel’s <i>Lekach-tob</i>, which was written in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and was the first
Catechism of Jewish Religion. It was composed in the Hebrew Language and subsequently
translated into Latin and English. Since last century, however, religious books of
all sizes, forms and tendencies have been produced in all <span class="pageNum" id="pb509">[<a href="#pb509">509</a>]</span>countries, especially in Germany. The following list contains such books as are included

<p>Page 329, note 2.—Doubt has been expressed as to the rule in the case of Mezuzah.
The rule certainly does apply. We must bear in mind that the form of the blessings
is determined by the general circumstances of the Mitsvah, and not by the exceptional
conditions. As a rule the owner of the house, or a member of his household fixes <span class="pageNum" id="pb540">[<a href="#pb540">540</a>]</span>the Mezuzah, whilst in the case of <span class="asc">SHOFARL</span>, <span class="asc">MILAH</span>, and the like the Mitsvah is as a rule performed by a substitute.
</p>
<p>Page 300, note 4.—This note refers to the cases of a Jew being compelled by the laws
of the State to do on Sabbath what the Divine Law forbids. The remark applies also
to those who, in seeking a living, yield to the force of the circumstances, and break
the Sabbath laws. Every possible opportunity should he seized to remind them of the
existence of Sabbath and to inspire them with a desire to keep the Fourth Commandment.
Care should, however, be taken that the means employed for this purpose should not
cause the Sabbath to be utterly ignored, and Judaism utterly forgotten. Such would,
<i>e.g.</i>, be the result if Jewish congregations were to institute special Sunday services
for those who are unwilling to attend the Synagogue on Sabbath, or to join their brethren
in the ordinary morning or evening Services.
</p>
<p>Page 411.—In the Portuguese Synagogues no Haphtarah is read on Fast-days during the
Minchah service, except on the 9th of Ab, when Hosea xiv, 2–10, and Micah vii, 18–20
is read.
</p>
<p>Page 441.—In the Portuguese rite the prayer “<i>alenu</i>” is preceded and not followed by a “Kaddish of the Orphans.”
